I was sitting at a table between two modular homes. I was facing approximately, North, North-East.  At the time of the siting, I looked up about 45 degrees and saw a light in the sky.  Then there was a second light to the left of the first one. I first thought there these were early stars, but the sky was still quite blue, the star Antaries, which usually came out first, directly above, was not out yet.My first thought was that I was seeing an aircraft, or a satellite, or a space station.  I commented to my friend about seeing two lights.  Then the one to the left started to move to the left.  As it did, two other lights appeared about these first two.  They were closer together than the firs two.  Then the second light that moved to the left disappeared.  Thie direction would be toward the North West. Now there was just the three.  Then the upper two lights disappeared followed by the first light.I was puzzled because, these lights really looked like faint stars, but it was too early for stars to appear. The final formation of these four points of light could be labeled like the geometric figure known as a trapezoid.  The lower left point of light was the one that moved away. I tried to see if the other three moved in any direction. They did not. They only disappeared.Thirty minutes later when the Great Dipper came out I tried to get my bearings to determine which part of the sky these lights appeared. This was approximately above the constellation of Cassiopeia.  But not as high as the North Star.This siting was so unusual that I got up from the dinner table and started mentioning to my friend that there were some lights in the sky and that one was moving. It was shortly after standing up that the other two higher lights appeared and then disappeared. My friend also got up from the table.  I pointed to the area of the sky where I was seeing the lights.  I asked him if he saw the lights, but he said he did not see any lights.Usually I wear contact lenses in both eyes.  For over a month I have not worn a contact lens in my left eye, in order to prepare for an eye test, prior to cataract surgery.  I was only wearing one contact lens in my right eye.   My vision in my right eye, with corrective lens is better than normal.  It is between 20/50 and 20/70.   I am very certain that I say what I saw.

The source was moving wards the north-northeast in a smooth steady motion, which I estimated given its relative distance of roughly one quarter mile from my position to be traveling at between fifty and seventy mph.As it flew, the source appeared to make a small, very smooth deviation from the straight course it had been following when I initially noted it, and in a long lazy arc came to a complete stop in the sky approximately at an angle of sixty degrees above the horizon, wherein it seemed to perform a complete stop and then in a matter of seconds faded away to nothingness (this effect may have been achieved by the source moving away from me on an easterly course, gradually being lost from view, or by some other means).I was able at the time to motion capture approximately fifty-nine seconds of the source objects flight using a Kodak EasyShare C813 8.0 MP camera, which when played back seemed to indicate that it was spinning, and was not entirely orange in color.  Instead, brilliant instances of white and a very brilliant and distinct blue hue were also in evidence.Sadly, due to my initial attempts at sighting the camera on a moving object set against a black sky and under less than ideal circumstances, the initial footage is shaky, but still clear enough for it to be clear enough for analysis.  At the time of the incident, the sky was heavily overcast with broken slow moving clouds.  There was a full moon, and the source appeared to be moving along some distance below the cloud base.  I wish to point out that the route on which the object was seen is part of the regular flight path for aircraft coming into Southampton Airport, yet it was moving counter to the established route and was seen to be carrying lights ((which were not)) consistent with known aircraft.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Peter,My apologies, that was an obvious and somewhat unfortunate mistake on my part. The date should read, July 31st 2010, not August as you so rightly pointed out.  Also, be advised that a small typo should be amended, it is &quot;yet it was moving counter to the established route and was seen to be carrying lights consistent with known aircraft,&quot; which should read:&quot;...yet it was moving counter to the established route and was seen to be carrying lights which were not consistent with known aircraft.&quot;Thank you.  If you are interested in the footage, it is just under 60 seconds long and in MOV format just under 18MB long. If you know of any reliable means wherein I can send that securely without correuption and at a lower file size, I would be interested in hearing about it.  Thank you for contacting me.  I have an additional comment to add.  I have only just learned from my father who lives at the nearby village of Fair Oak, Hampshire, some seven and one half miles from me that on the night of August 25th, approximately 22:50 hours, he observed two independently operating orange spherical light sources.  In the course of the observation, the objects travelled an undisclosed distance, probably no more than one quarter miles knowing the viewpoint that he had, and from south to northeast.  The sighting was terminated when one of the objects stopped abruptly in mid-flight and shot straight up at considerable speed, followed five seconds later by the second, both subsequently vanishing from sight. I can attempt to obtain additional details, but this is certainly curious given the nature of the object that I personally observed and managed to capture in motion.Thanks.((END ADDENDUM))((NUFORC Note:  All requested corrections have been made in the text above.

The craft entered the corridor and at this point continuing his northwest heading at a very high rate of speed and what appeared to be the same altitude and as the situation progressed appeared to be on a collision course with the airli! ner.  As I was watching a pit began to grow in my stomach thinking &ldquo;oh no this might be a bad deal.&rdquo;   The craft continued its heading and it appeared they were going to make physical contact.  The craft narrowly missed the airliner&rsquo;s tail section (I am estimating because of regulation altitude per FAA standards) was about a 1/8th of a mile.  The thought crossed my mind that this may be an intercept mission by the Air Force and was engaging the airliner.  The craft then banked hard left, same rate of speed coming along side then accelerated banking hard left again this time at an impossible angle of attack cutting in front of the airliner then moved to left wing of the airliner then came to an absolute dead stop off the left wing of the airliner.  I watched in amazement as the airliner continued its flight path all the while keeping my eyes locked on the other craft.  Once the airliner was past the other craft dimmed itself to match surrounding stars.  I stood for another 20 minut! es transfixed on the craft. I then began to notice other airli! ners div erting in a northwest arc the first aircraft coming on the scene banking hard right as I believe enroute control diverted them because of the situation.  As this aircraft diverted I tried to keep an eye on the stationary craft.  I waited about 2 minutes then turned to see the location of the airliner which by my estimate was at about the same northwest vector as when the craft  approached the first airliner at.  I then turned to look and the craft lit back up and accelerated at a blinding speed to intercept the diverted airliner.  It impressed me that this craft had a curiosity factor to it and it seemed that it was almost playful in its demeanor.}"

All this took place between 9 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. local time.Around 9 p.m. I went out for my evening star gazing and watching the satellites go by.At the start I saw what I can only describe as flashes of light in the sky.  The flashes of light looked like a flash from a camera.  Then I observed what I thought was a satellite until the satellite went from moving from a northern to southern direction to veering to a southwesterly direction.  Satellites do not normally change their directional course as they cannot.  They always move in the same direction without veering off course.  This satellite seemed to be dark gray in color and was silhouetted against the night sky. I saw this with my naked eye.Then I saw the similar flashes of light again.  After this I saw another &quot;satellite&quot; that was moving across the sky.  This time the satellite stopped, then let off a &quot;pouf&quot; of periwinkle to white color, then moved again.  I observed through binocs what seemed to be a lighted object with periwinkle and white lights.  This satellite then moved and faded away.  Approximately a half hour later this same satellite reappeared towards the southwest portion of the sky and repeated the same set of movements and colorations before fading out.I saw the flashes of light each time before the bluish white satellite reappeared.This was also seen by another witness who was with me.  This witness would like to remain anonymous.I checked Heavens Above and could find nothing that might fit what we saw.  Perhaps you can find something.None of this stuff was close.

I first noticed it at 35 degrees WNW from my location.  It continued up overhead to about 85 degrees (almost directly overhead) and gradually faded out of view as it got smaller and smaller ESE at about 10 degrees above the horizon.  It took about 25 seconds to move this distance.  I did not hear a sound coming from this object so I would say that it was above the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere but not as high as the International Space Station (ISS) as I&rsquo;ve spotted that a few times on separate occasions and on one occasion I saw the station also pass almost directly overhead like this object.  I cannot be certain how high the object was but that is my impression.The object appeared to be a flame although it was different from a typical rocket in that although it remained relatively constant it had a slight flicker to it like the flickering of a candle only a more rapid flickering with more of a sustained luminescence.  The flame appeared to have an edge on the forward side and came to a point at a length of about twice its width.  I could not discern a physical object in front of the flame as I was looking for something in front thinking it was perhaps a missile or the space shuttle.  The light of the object was about half as bright as the ISS at its brightest when I had seen the ISS at about a year ago passing directly overhead.I saw only the one object and it&rsquo;s motion was continual and followed a straight path and it was moving at least twice as fast as the ISS (or perhaps the same speed but maybe half the distance?).  This object literally appeared to be rocketing across the sky.  It&rsquo;s size from my perspective was about 1/8th the size of a full moon as it passed overhead.  There were 4-5 other witnesses across the street about a 100 feet away from me.}"

There are no cities in this area, very wooded area, i may have been the only witness, i watched the sky smoking a cigarette just as subject floated into place.

It reminded in the sky for a few seconds, then disappeared; poof it was gone.  Brief seconds later it reappeared in the same place then suddenly become two and moved apart slightly, then disappeared: poof gone.Brief seconds later the single light reappeared and then quickly blinked out.  There was no sound.  They seemed very far away  The lights were not the same red as lights on airplanes or helicopters.  My sister is in her mid- 40&apos;s, very intelligent, very down to earth.  I was surprised when she said, &quot; I saw them too.&quot;  2.  Later, after 10 pm, my two sons (14 and 17) and my brother (early 40&apos;s) were sitting on the same 2nd floor porch looking towards the ocean.  My son (17) saw a large, saucer-ish shaped object, about the size of the moon only not the moon, not round, not white, but red on the outside, fading into bright yellow on the inside.It appeared out of nowhere. It slowly (but still in brief seconds) moved to the left and remained there for 2 seconds.  It slowly (but still in brief seconds) separated in 5 objects, reddish orange in color, saucer-ish shape.  but smaller than the original mass.  It was as though the large saucer-ish shaped light was covering the 5 smaller masses and it disappeared to uncover the 5 smaller things.  Then they disappeared from the outside in: they went from 5 to 3 to 1 to none.  My son (14) had the impression of a red light that &quot; looked sort of like fire&quot; that &quot; looked like it sort of came in&quot; and then &quot; went out.&quot;   My brother was not looking in the same direction and missed all of this because happened so quickly.  My sons both have good heads on their shoulders as far as I know.  My brother is ultra logical.  I was down stairs.  My sons came and got me and I went back up to the porch.3.  Now my 2 sons and my brother and I are sitting on the 2nd floor porch (between 10:30pm and 11pm), raptly studying the sky over the ocean.  After about 30 min. suddenly a large (moon sized) saucer-ish object came out of absolutely nowhere.  It was the reddish, orange color. No sound.

(It was twilight yet one could still discern the horizon tree line and the moving unlit object.)  After another approximate 5 minutes, the Eastern object&rsquo;s lights faded out and it also moved rapidly west until obscured by what seemed to be clouds.Residing only 40 miles from an international airport, 15 miles from 2 municipal airports and 3 hospital heliports and at least 2 private airfields, during my past 25 years I have witnessed a number of varying aircraft servicing these facilities.The observation of 07/19/10 seems to be an anomaly from what I have previously observed.I have never seen a plane, helicopter, or other flying object turn away at night and not have at least a tail beacon.These had nothing.}"

I noticed that at the top of a nearby tree there was a blinking light. As I studied it closer I saw red, blue, white, green, and orange lights flickering very quickly. It reminded me of a sign you would see in a store to grab peoples attention.  I showed my friends to confirm what I saw and they started finding more of these objects.  There was the main one (we called it the big one) above the tree, then, we started spotting one over lower trees to the right (we called it the right one). Then, one popped up in-between those two (we called it the middle one), and eventually one showed up underneath the big one. Now, my friends claimed to see very small ones surrounding them sometimes diving, flying around or &ldquo;attacking&rdquo; the main ones.  A few times we saw what looked like large bright shooting stars shoot down from them but it didn&rsquo;t shoot acro! ss the sky, it quickly fell, seeming as if it may have fell to the ground.  We also saw beams of light across the sky often appearing to be blue. There was also this area that we called &ldquo;the group&rdquo; because it looked like a cluster of dim, glowing lights.I am sure these could not have been planes because we watched for hours and the objects were still in the sky around 6 o&rsquo;clock am.  Planes go over our area frequently and the lights and slow speed were just a few things to prove they weren&rsquo;t. It was truly one of the most intriguing, weird, and exciting things I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Also, I forgot to mention that the lights seemed to arrange in trianles at times}"

I picked up mine to get a closer look, and lo and behold, there was a group of lights hovering over the ocean.  At first we thought it was probably a cargo ship, but the lights were way too high for a ship.  There were a group of 5 lights; one red, three yellowish and one yellowish-white.  All of a sudden the lights began to change shape, from triangle to rectangle and then back to triangle again.  The yellowish-white light was below the others and moving back and forth over the water. None were blinking, just hovering and forming triangle and rectangle shapes.  After a while it drifted north and the lights began to dim and it slowly disappeared.  It lasted for about 20 minutes.

19970615,6/15/1997,20100731,7/31/2010, Peoria, IL,IL,USA,Midwest, disk,3 minutes,3,180,short,"Two people see UFO hovering at a distance of 10 feet.I heard Peter Davenport on the 07-29-10 episode of Coast to Coast AM and decided to submit my story.Headline: UFO at a stone&apos;s throw  This story takes place in 1992 in Illinois.My friend and I were parked facing north at night in the summer on a small concrete bridge over a small creek in rural Illinois.  We were not quite ready to go home and wanted to continue our conversation about &quot;girlfriends.&quot;  The weather was cloudy and misty.  We could see sheet lighting in the distance.  My car windows had droplets of water on them.  I sat in the driver&apos;s seat, my friend sat in the passenger&apos;s seat of my Ford Escort.The creek bridge had cement guardrails that were almost perfectly level with where the car windows started.  I suspect this was a purposeful choice by the architect. The road continued on north to a T-section about 1/4 down the road.  Beyond that intersection was a large hill that spanned for miles in each direction.  Approach to the creek bridge was as if going down a slight hill, and the incline continued on for awhile and then began sloping up again toward the T-section.  We were of a slightly higher altitude than the cornfields directly to the left and right front of us that bordered the creek.  The border of the creek was a slight hill that blocked view of the field beyond to our right (2 o&apos;clock).  Over our right shoulders at about 4 o&apos;clock (direction), was four-story tall mound/hill left over from an old gravel pit that had trees and brush all over it.  This mound followed the other creek border for about a half a mile to the east.So from our perspective, we could not see the field to our right front, nor see beyond over the hill over our right shoulders.  The creek was essentially bordered on both sides with land that stretched out as far as the eye could see.  It was here that we watched the lighting in the distance.   I could see the lightening from tens of miles away over the top of the distant hills, but there was additional light coming from closer up.  At first I just dismissed it as ball lighting, but I could see the light illuminating the mist just above the hill.  I could not see into the field where the light seemed to be coming from, just the effects of the light on the trees on the border of the creek.  I stopped my friend from talking and said, &quot;Friend, why is that lightening going on and off with a beat.  Nature is not that exact.&quot;  I began snapping my fingers to the rate of the light from the field going on and off.  On, snap, off, snap.  It was a perfect beat (I am a musician).  I tol! d my friend to roll down his window and just as the window rolled down, a craft popped out from behind the hill.  It was level with us, and we were approximately at most 10 ft from the craft.  I could have easily jumped on top of the craft from the side of the bridge without straining myself.I was speechless.  At the time I was morally opposed to the idea of alien spacecraft.  My family were strict Christians who specifically were taught at our denomination that humans on Earth were the only organic life in the universe.  I was 100% against the ideas of aliens existing.  Yet, here before me and my friend was this totally silent craft, about the size of a large SUV, hovering, silently.I broke the silence by startling loudly, &quot;THAT IS NOT A UFO!&quot;  At the time that I said that, the craft was just a little past us.  The craft was almost directly to our right, but a little farther past us at that point.  It abruptly changed course (as if it heard me) and either turned off its lights, put on a cloaking device or did something else because it seemed to just go right into the opposite hill, but more likely it just went &quot;dark.&quot;  I revved up my engine and drove away very fast.  My perspective on everything had just come crashing down in one fell swoop of time no more than 3 minutes long.I got to my house, where my friend&apos;s car was, and he asked me to follow him back home (because he was too freaked out to go over that bridge alone).  So I followed him home.  By the time I got back to the bridge, my fear had gone down, and I was filled with wonder.  The storm had passed, so I parked on the bridge again alone, turned on a Cure CD and sat Indian style on the roof of my car, searching the landscape and the sky for anything out of the ordinary.Nothing.  Silence.Oddly, it was from that moment on that I started to experience the phenomenon known as &quot;synchronicity.&quot;  As I drove back to my house that night, I though, &quot;what if when I get home my family has been abducted!&quot;  I got home and went to my parent&apos;s bedroom and listened for breathing.  Nothing, so I turned on the light and the bed was empty and made, at like 2 a.m.!  I ran to my sister&apos;s rooms and they were all empty too.  I was freaked out so I just collapsed in bed, thinking in the morning this will all be resolved.I awoke to a call from my mother that the family left town unexpectedly that evening to visit relatives.Description of the craft:  Closure took over in my perception of the craft, so my brain processed the craft as looking like the time machine in Back to the Future (big fan at the time).  It was the only way my brain could process a floating silent vehicle, that and it also did look a lot like that craft.  It had a metallic brushed reflective surface, with an area like a car where the &quot;people&quot; were transported, and then a front and back section much like our engine and trunk section.  It as the classic saucer shape, but without the dramatic flaring sides.   It had lights in various places on the exterior but it all happened so fast and I was so stunned that I couldn&apos;t tell you the exact placement, but my friend who had no such &quot;stunned&quot; effect because he was already a believer, said he saw lights in the back, front, top and bottom of the craft.For now, any contact, I would prefer it to be done via email.((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident in 1992 is approximate.

It appeared to be in a triangle with a flat shaped nose.  The visibility last night was unlimited.  There were clouds to the east of our location and the object was definitely below the cloud height.  The object was glowing the entire time as it moved across the sky.I would estimate the height of the object to be about 1200 feet off the ground.  It moved very fast, steady and very smooth as it flew across the sky.  It was absolutely 100% not an airplane.  Being in the Air Force for almost 11 years I have seen my fair share of aircraft and this was most certainly not one.  It made absolutely no sound.  I would estimate the object to be about 2 1/2 miles away from where we were.  The sighting lasted approx 25 seconds.  From the time I first viewed the object to the time I could no longer see it had moved about 110 degrees across the sky east to west.

I have a part time job delivering the AnnArbor.com newspaper on Thursday and Sunday Mornings.  I typically start delivering my papers at around 2:00 am.  I have ~150 customers and I have a very set routine of delivering my route.  On the Morning of July 22, 2010, at exactly 2:40am (I just remembered that I called my wife when this event happened and I verified the time when I called her).  I called my wife at 2:42 am and told her about what I saw and that I was coming home because I was too freaked out to continue delivering my papers.There is a street called Louis Lane in Hamburg, MI.  It is a residential street in a generally rural area and the street is probably &frac12; to &frac34; mile long and is in the shape of a horseshoe.  The street is along the north side of the main road (Strawberry Lake Road).  Imagine breaking the horseshoe shaped street into two parts, the eastern half of the street and the western half of the street.  I always begin delivering papers on this street on the eastern portion of the horseshoe and am facing north when I pull into this street.  I pulled into a customer&rsquo;s driveway, threw the paper up by the garage, and reversed out of the driveway to continue on my way.  When I began to proceed, I saw a flash of blueish light (like lightning) along the northern horizon.  I looked out my windshield to see if a storm was maybe on its way, but it was one of the clearest nights this summer.  However, at that moment a second flash was closer and brighter and my NPR radio station cut to static for may! be 5 seconds.  This was really creepy, but I continued on my way.  At this point I was rounding the top of the Horseshoe and was facing west, I looked out my driver side window which was facing to the south and that is when I saw what really made me think about it being a &quot;U.F.O.&quot;   The object that I witnessed was about 20 degrees off of the southern horizon, just above a line of trees.  The object was less than 100&rsquo; in the air, it was glowing electric blue in color, it was approximately the size of a quarter and was definitely close, I&rsquo;d say within a &frac14; mile distance.  The object moved westward while it descended behind the trees and appeared to land.As I watched the object disappear behind the trees, I continued to drive slowly and was now facing south and was now on the western portion of Louis Lane.  I put my car in park and turned off my lights and continued to look south towards where I saw the object disappear.  I stayed for maybe a minute and witnessed some intermittent blue colored flashing coming from the direction of the object.  I called my wife at exactly 2:42 am and told her what I just saw.  I told her that I didn&rsquo;t want to finish my route at night and was going to wait until day to finish.  I was pretty scared, so I got out of the neighborhood, and drove east at 75 mph down Strawberry Lake Road, until I got into town.I stopped at the Hamburg Township Police department and seriously considered walking in to report what I saw, but I didn&rsquo;t.  In Hamburg, MI, there is a 24-hour ((deleted)) gas station that I always stop at before I start my route.  I always ((speak)) with the guy who works midnights, his name is ((name deleted)).  On my way back home, I stopped to tell ((name deleted)) what I saw.  ((name deleted)) was in some disbelief, but he said that it was kind of strange because there was a very brief loss of electricity at the gas station at around the same time that I told him what I saw.  ((name deleted)) said that it could be the Police helicopters, because they look for people growing marijuana at night.  I expressed that I didn&rsquo;t think it was a helicopter, because the whole thing was glowing electric blue.  I then drove the 10 miles back to my house, eventually went to sleep and finished delivering my papers when it was light outside.I am a ((deleted)) student and attend ((deleted)) school in Ann Arbor, MI.  I told a few students what had happened earlier that morning, and two of my classmates, said that they were up late and also experienced the brief power outage at around the same time.  However, these guys live in the city of Ann Arbor, and I was nearly 15 miles north of the City of Ann Arbor when this happened.The event that I witnessed was very brief and I left before I could see anything else happen.  Just thinking about this event still makes my skin crawl.  I used to prefer delivering my papers when its dark, but I seriously don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m ever going to start my route until the sun comes up.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be sober-minded and credible.

However , I must admit that I felt slightly ridiculed as someone had written his own evaluation of what I saw on that report by  adding the following lie to it &quot; possibly Jupiter in the southern sky&quot; .  The trees where the UfO was silently floating are  30 ft away from my house!  One cannot put a planet in those trees!  The ufo was directly behind the trees, moving and changing its appearance. I saw the perfectly bright lights in detail and its pulsating lights.  Planets do not move, display lights and change appearance.  This was a moving object not  Jupiter.  I feel slightly insulted by this odd addition to my Report. It should not be there.     Best, ((END ADDENDUM))((NUFORC Note:  The witness may be correct, but we believe it is the rare UFO that hangs around for an hour and a half.  PD))}"

When it disappeared behind the tree line, it seemed to us to be maybe a half mile away, and we sped up to what we thought would be the scene of a crash site.Of course, there was no crash, and we tuned in a local radio station to see if there had been an airplane crash in the area.  There was none.This area is across the Hudson River from Stewart Air base, now a commercial airport, and we are both very used to seeing fairly low commercial and military planes, including the huge C-5 Galaxy military transport planes.We only saw the lights for at best 3 seconds, and other than the fact that there were several colored lights which seemed to be along the fuselage of what we thought was the plane (which is unusual) the only thing we could reasonably come up with was that it was a large commercial jet.  Both of us agree there were white, green, and red lights.I&rsquo;m reporting this because it isn&rsquo;t possible for a plane of that size to be going that fast in a vertical position straight down, that close to the ground, and not crash.  Neither of us can explain how that would be possible, so we&rsquo;ve questioned if what we saw was a plane.  This is not the only time I&apos;ve reported a sighting to your website, but this is certainly the shortest sighting, and yet still very strange.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I was out alone snowmobiling, at about 7:30 at nite, when I stopped to view some faint Northern Lights, when I was South of Fairbanks, Alaska, about 2 miles, clear sky.  I noticed  an unusual star formation of 5 shiny objects, in a perfect Pentagon pattern.  That is what caught my eyes, as there were a tremendous number of stars visible, due to the very Clear Arctic sky.  After some 2 minutes or so, I saw them all converge, at the same time, into the center of the Pentagon, at an upward angle, leaving a shiny trail behind each one, like a flash.  After several seconds, after they formed what appeared to be a single object, the single now larger object left up an upward angle into space, at an amazing speed. leaving what appeared to be a streak of light, until the object got smaller, and smaller, then eventually disappeared in some 5 seconds or so!   Amazing!  The objects appeared to be silvery shiny, and very small, for altitude,  I would guess some 15 to 30 miles!   I wish I had a digital camera!  How the objects went from a Pentagon formation, into one object was amazing, all moved at the same time, and converged at the same point, all together, then after a few seconds, the now larger silvery object, traveled out into space at about a 80 degree angle, very fast, leaving just one solid streak of light as it accelerated away.I have done a lot of work on Weather Balloon systems, Radiosonde Tracking Systems, called WBRT&apos;s, for many years, and have tracked these many times as part of my job.  I have also seen several visible rocket launches on experiments by the Univ. Of Alaska, ESSA, etc., in tracking Aurora Borealis, Northern Lights.  I had a good background of electronics, radio, and radars, etc., and Weather Observations.I have talked to Eskimos in the Arctic, at Point Barrow, Nome, Kotzebue, and Barter Island, of some of their sightings over the Arctic Ocean.  This was the first, and only time, I have ever seen anything so unusual, that I could not identify.  I have worked extensively with certified Weather Observers at many airports, and very familiar with Weather Observations, etc.Now, I am retired from NOAA NWS, having worked on their new WSR-88D NEXRAD Doppler Radars, with their towers, having Fiberglass Panels, in the shape of a Pentagon!

A few minutes later, I and my girlfriend noticed other objects like the one I have described and for the next hour and a half we watched 14 or  more of them moving west in a straight line and one consistant speed which was rather slow. Most of the objects looked round but some were triangle shaped.  Most were moving slowly west but, some just hoovered in one spot.  One hoovered for 30 min and then slowly moved north. I went to the army surplus across the street and told the guys working there about the objects.  They got some binoculars and we looked at one of the objects.  Through the bino&apos;s I could see that the object was 3 white orbs held in a triangle frame like thing.  And as we watched another white object moved toward this 3-orbed object and was very neat it before it vanished. All of the objects were very high up.  When jets would pass by , one could see that these objects were way higher in the sky than the jets.The objects made no sound , they made turns, changed directions , and moved in straight lines as well as hovering.  NO high speed stuff.  One thing I noticed, when I was looking at some of these objects, I would notice another similar object  behind the object I was looking at that was much much higher up.((NUFORC Note:}"

The two lights were reddish orange and flew through the sky at the same distance of each other.  After following the lights for about 5 - 10 minutes the first bright light completely stopped.  The second light caught up to the first one and they joined together.   The one light started flying east and higher in the sky.

There was a white light glimmering from the top of the Poteau Mountains and stayed there for at least 5 minutes or more.  We thought it was a fire on the mountain but soon discovered it was not producing smoke, the fireworks show started and we forgot all about it.  Today I was going through photos and remembered the light.  Not sure what it was but know it was not a fire (lack of smoke) and not fireworks because it was there for so long.

The object was moving at a steady rate from west to east, unblinking, without changing apparent direction. After watching it for about 5 seconds, the light &quot;winked out&quot; and very briefly returned to view, continuing its course, before &quot;winking out&quot; again. The sky was not yet fully dark, but the light source of the object was distinct and bright. The &quot;winking out&quot; seemed to be consistent with a 90-degree turn along the plane of sight, but there was no continuation of sight after the second &quot;winking&quot; episode. The light did not flash, nor were there any standard airplane colored lights (red, green, or white) associated with it. I am unable to judge the distance of the object or its actual size. In shape it appeared to be circular, perhaps because of distance.I have taken courses in astronomy and have seen many satellites and meteors over the years. This object was too bright to be a satellite; it was not yet dark enough and the ambient light should have been sufficient to block a satellite from view. The sudden &quot;winking out&quot; was inconsistent with a satellite. It moved too slowly to be a meteor.}"

Again I&apos;m not sure what I saw but I know it wasn&apos;t anything that could be explained at the time.One night I decided to go outside and cool off on the patio.  I looked up and started to star gaze to pass the time when I noticed that the stars&apos; pattern flickered in and out almost like someone was moving a huge rectangle of glass across the sky.  The size of the anomaly was pretty decent, about the size of a large passenger air plane.  The weird thing about this is that there was no sound distortion in the air, so I knew it wasn&apos;t a plane or big helicopter, and there was no wind so it wasn&apos;t as if there was some strange item blowing across the sky.I watched the glass-rectangle thing start to cross the horizon, it looked almost as if it paused, then moved again in stops and starts.  I decided then to go inside to grab something to assist in viewing it better like my binoculars or video camera, but when I came out the pattern was gone.  There were no lights, no oblong shapes, no sudden heat, and no repeat of what I saw. Just thought I&apos;d send this up in case anyone had ever seen something like this before.((NUFORC Note:  Witness provides no contact information.  PD))}"

We are all professionals between 35 and 56 years old.  We were watching fireworks around the lake from the dock.  We saw 3 separate sightings of similar UFO objects about 15 minutes apart-they were NOT an aircraft that anyone could identify-no flashing lights typical of aircraft, movements were not typical of planes, and no airplane noises were heard.The objects sight came from the horizon at the south-west (the first object came from a point furthest to the west compared to the other two) and traveled northerly up the lake pulsating a orangish/red glow. Their sizes at their largest point was about twice that of Venus, which was visible just above the western horizon and at least as bright if not brighter.  Each time, their altitudes were at least a few thousand feet (guessing-based on the height of the surrounding hills from the water).Most of their movements were similar in character to each other with erratic speed (fast then slow) and motions -veering off to one side or the other, sometimes instantly reversing their direction - sometimes appearing to stop or hover along their mainly northern route before continuing. None of the movements were super-fast.All three sightings ended similarly in that they appeared to stop in about the same location to our south (distance unknown and very difficult to even guess) although their routes to get to that area were slightly different.  After being stationary a few seconds-they got brighter and brighter then began to move south and upward slowly (in relation to our position) as their light dimmed and then vanished.  The second object re-appeared briefly (and dully) after a second or so of turning south disappearing, remaining visible for one or two more seconds again - which helped to verify that it was still moving after we lost sight of it before it then vanished.The first sighting was approximately 5-6 minutes long, with the second and third being a little over 4 minutes.}"

This is about 8 miles North of Omaha, Nebraska.On the night of the fourth of July, I was standing out at the end of my driveway taking pictures of fireworks with a Canon 40D SLR with a digital image stabilizing lens that is 70-300mm zoom.  (About $3000.00 worth of equipment). I was not using a tripod, but hand held so I could move around to catch the fireworks.The front of my house faces straight West.  The night had a broken cloud base, more open than clouds.  At approximately 9:55 pm I noticed a reddish orange light to the South, South west from where I was standing about 2 to 3 miles away coming from the Bennington Nebraska area.  It was moving very slow to slow to be a plane and heading almost straight North.  It had no blinking lights at all. It was just above the cloud base.  I had my camera set on manual mode and was running the shutter speed between 4 and 8. I took a few pictures of the light and after zooming in on it I could see that it wasn&rsquo;t one light, but three real close together.  We have had helicopters come by and at about that distance before and we could not hear a thing when normally we could.  After watching it for about 5 minutes, I went back to the house to get my wife and show it to her.  Of course she saw it also.They continued to travel North until they were just South of my location, then took a 90 degree turn to the East for a very short distance (guessing &frac12; to 1 mile) then another 90 degree turn back to the South.  Looking at the night sky it would be like the directions of the eraser end of a new pencil.  After watching them head back South about &frac12; the distance from when I first noticed them.  It was like someone threw a light switch and the lights went out.  Gone.  Way before they would have flown out of sight.About 10 to 15 minutes later I saw them again straight in front of my house, looking West.  They looked to be about 1 to 2 miles out.  There were different times that through the camera I could see that they didn&rsquo;t stay in a group, but would spread out in a line.  If it was one object I would see a leader and then a trail, with the lens settings I was using,  However you can see the trails, but with three balls in the trail.  A leader, one in the middle and one towards the end.  I took 55 pictures of them in all.  They kept heading in a Northern direction and it looked like they would have gone just North of Blair Nebraska.  Some pictures came out pretty good, some not, due to the speed of the lens or my movement.  The entire time that they were visible was about 20 to 30 minutes.}"

After trying to put sticks under the tire to get leverage to drive out we gave up and decided to walk to the main road we drove on and to stay on that road until we could find a house to call for help..(We were in the middle of nowhere.) We walked I would guess 3 miles then us 4 including myself saw two &quot;balls of fire&quot; in the air about 30 yards off the road we were walking on. They did not appear to be large, maybe the size of a basketball. They moved quickly in all kinds of directions. Not sure how to explain it. We got scared and started running down the road, until we were a good distance away from the &quot;fire balls&quot;. We stopped and watched and the 2 fire balls continued to move quickly in many directions but never really leaving the same area. We were still scared so decided to run again. W! e ran until the fireballs were out of sight. (Ran for about 5 minutes streight).

At first it looked like a hot air balloon possibly on fire, but then it was moving too fast to be one and looked less like one the closer it got.  There was a darker center to this object.  Size wise, the object would be more comparable to the size of the moon than to any stars from our perspective on Earth and much larger than any meteor I have seen.   It was about the size that a dime looks when extending your arm fully and looking up at it.  It was closer to the ground than a plane would be flying, but higher than a bird would be flying in the sky.  The object was not at all comparable to fireworks, remote controlled airplanes, etc.  It had an orange glow emitting from it which looked almost like fire does, although I could see no flames. It moved toward the Northern sky and disappeared out of sight.  At first the glowing object was stationary but then it started moving.  The flight pattern was mostly horizontal, although it did rise straight up and go straight down twice and it moved diagonally in the sky once.  This all happened in a matter of 30 - 45 seconds if not longer I would guess.  It was much quicker than a plane would be viewed moving in the sky, although it did hesitate a few times.  There were no sounds associated with this.Witness:  I was the only witness to this at my location and did not have a camera or video recorder on me.

It looked similar to the way a satellite looks(only considerably bigger and a different color), but appeared to all of us to be much lower in the sky than a satellite.  It seemed to be at about the same altitude that a small aircraft would fly.  I&apos;d estimate maybe only 4 or 5 thousand feet.  It was a very deep unchanging orange/reddish color.  It was moving the opposite direction as we were (west to east), and was visible for about 5 minutes before it just kind of blinked out.  It wasn&apos;t moving particularly fast.  I&apos;d say maybe in the 100-125mph range?

We live below a flight path of the airport so we often see incoming planes in the distance, but usually the planes we see have many red and white lights that are constantly flashing.  This object had one big red glowing light (perhaps a distant orb but all we could see was a bright red light).  We talked about the possibility of a satellite, but it was so red, and seemed much closer.It moved slowly across the sky.

The light was moving slow enough that I figured I would have time to get my glasses before the view of the light would be blocked by the trees.

It was almost silent, but looked almost like it was spinning the body part of it, but was just moving forward.  It was the strangest thing!  I started freaking out, and yelled for my boyfriend.

This time the craft came down and had it&rsquo;s lights out and seemed to be a bit bigger than the other one that went over my house.  I could clearly see this space craft because of the street lights behind m! y house in the court. It was clearly a flying saucer, disk shaped.

To fully view the light we continued through the densely wooded area to an opening on top of a hill.  The front seat passenger and rear seat passenger tried to identify it as a star, however, it was visibly much larger than any of the other stars in the sky, including Venus and Jupiter.  Also, it was a different color than either of the planets and due to the size, appeared much closer.  As we rounded the road to the top of the hill, about a mile and a half away from sighting the first light, the rear and front seat passengers turned to face the object, which had now drifted to the Northeast.  Upon relocating the object, and getting above the tree line, they noticed another light to the East.  I, the driver, was also able to see the objects clearly.We were only about a half a mile from McHardy Road, which runs North and South; we decided to turn North onto it to get a better view.  While turning and advancing down the road the sky became more visible as the trees receded below us and about three more orange objects were clearly visible.The two passengers kept their eyes one the objects as we proceeded another half mile North on McHardy before pulling over and stopping the vehicle.  It was then 12:07 and we exited the car to watch the objects.  At this time, we decided to call the NUFORC hotline and report the sighting; also there now appeared to be seven orange orbs in the sky.  During this time, the objects seemed to drift or float toward the Northeast slightly, and nearly one by one they faded out.  It did not appear that they moved beyond our visible sight, just that they were fading and no longer present. It took approximately three minutes for the entire group of lights to completely fade (12:10am).About thirteen minutes passed and the lights failed to return so we decided to get back into the car and head East in the general direction of the lights.

In my career I have seen many strange things, but this observation clearly tops them all as far as being unexplained.   On July 4, 2010, at approximately 2145 to 2155 hours, I was sitting near the bank of the Missouri River on the 300 Block of River Drive North in Great Falls Mt.  I was sitting with my family waiting for the city fireworks display that was set to start at approximately 2200 hours.  We were sitting on the east side of the river facing westbound where the fireworks display was going to be launched.As we were waiting for the show I noticed an aircraft flying eastbound over the city (Est. elevation 10,000 feet high).  Normally this would not be note worthy because we were sitting under the flight path of airplanes landing and taking off from the Great Falls International Airport.  This particular craft caught my attention because it appeared to flying too high to have just taken off from the runway.  Normally, I have noticed flights that don&rsquo;t land at the airport fly on the outskirts of the city.  Also, I noticed an extremely large glowing yellow/reddish color light underneath the aircraft.  The light took up the whole diameter of the craft.  The light appeared to be the approximate size of a Boeing 747.  I observed no red or green tail or wing lights on the craft.  There was no apparent spotlight shining in front of the craft.  I also could not hear the craft&rsquo;s engine.  It should be noted it was extremely windy and this could have had an effect on the sound waves reachi! ng my location.  The craft also appeared to be flying slower than a jet craft would have at that altitude that was not planning on landing.At this time, I pointed the craft out to my wife.  At the same time we both said we have never seen an airplane or helicopter that looked like that.  We debated over whether a satellite would have the same characteristics.  During this time there were approximately 15 people that were sitting near us on the riverbank.  Several of them were watching the craft also.  Some of their conversations were similar in nature to ours (Unknown names of the other witnesses).I continued to watch the craft as it continued eastbound until I lost site of it as it headed east past the city.  Great Falls has Malmstrom Air Force Base, Homeland Security Base, and the Montana Air National Guard.  My job has allowed me some access to these bases on occasion.  To my knowledge, none of the aircraft they fly looks like this.  After hearing about similar related sightings of this nature on July 4th on Coast to Coast, I felt compelled to pass on my observations.  I hope this information will help, I just wish there could be an explanation for what we observed.}"

20100703,7/3/2010,20100707,7/7/2010, Cincinnati, OH,OH,USA,Midwest, light,5 minutes,5,300,short,"Saw unknown persistent light in the sky and then a gray object that arced away when the light stopped.I was out birding Saturday evening at Valley View Preserve.  It was about 935pm.  There were scattered fireworks going off to the south and the northeast but I think it was still a little too light out for people to start setting things off in earnest.  The sky was clear or had a few clouds.  I was looking at and scanning the tree line with binoculars for perched owls when I saw this persistent orange-yellow light in the sky south or southwest hovering in the same spot at maybe 45-50 degrees above the horizon and not flickering.  The light was maybe 2 or 3 times larger than Venus in the sky and certainly way smaller than the moon.  I had no idea what it was but eventually figured it was either a) some kind of firework b) the back of a distant plane/jet or maybe c)the launch of some kind of rocket or something since the last weird thing I saw in the sky, that was kind of similar to this event, was part of an NSA Atlas rocket launch.After a few minutes of shining in exactly the same spot in the sky, the light stopped and I saw this gray, blurry object slowly arc a very short distance east from where the light had been until it faded away or I just lost track of it in the increasing darkness.  The gray object, which I figured was the emitter of the light, was roughly the same size as the light or maybe slightly smaller and possibly top-like in shape.  I watched the whole sequence with and without binoculars but don&apos;t recall the binoculars giving me a much better view of the event except that they more clearly revealed a non-flickering light.  The light was shining for a few minutes and I saw the gray object for probably less than 30 seconds.I don&apos;t know what it actually was but still think it could have been one of the things I thought it might be.  If it was a firework, I&apos;ve never seen anything exactly like it before.  The light looked sort of like a Roman candle if there was just one flare, no smoke trail and the flare stayed in one spot in the sky instead of moving in an arc.  If it was a plane, there should have been blinking lights on the object after the light, it should have moved in a more direct way and I should have heard some sort of sound.  I don&apos;t recall hearing any sounds that I could attribute to the light/object.  And if it was some sort of rocket, it didn&apos;t seem to leave Earth&apos;s atmosphere and was a little different than what I saw before.I had actually completely forgotten about this until Peter Davenport appeared on Coast to Coast AM and am submitting this report per his request.

The distance between the show and the orb was at least &frac12; mile when we spotted it.  (Judged buy the distance across the bay.)  After the first light passed into the tree line, completely opposite direction of the show, another orb of light came from the horizon behind the fireworks.  It also passed in the opposite direction of the display.Then on July 6th, at apx. 11:PM, my daughter and I saw the same type of light while sitting on our porch; apx. 5-7 miles from the area of the fireworks show on the 3rd.All three orbs were deep yellow to orange in color.  Their luminosity was steady, no pulsation, no fireball or comet-tail appearance.They passed at about the speed of an ultralite, from one horizon to the other.I&rsquo;m judging their height above the ground to be roughly the altitude a search plane might fly.  They definitely did not fly as high as a  passenger plane.None of us could hear a sound coming from it.All three orbs appeared to be about the size of a pea, held at arms length.  So what size that might be, relative to their apparent distance, someone with a degree in the sciences will have to calculate; I am not well educated in that area.}"

Another one blinked into focus, and the two got brighter and moved toward eachother.We talked and discussed if they were moving, what color they were and mentioned that we had not seen anything like that before.  Then another orange glowing ball was seen below the tree line and rose up to join the other two.The three orange spheres made a triangle with the two points on top and the third on bottom.  The top left point started fading away and was gone in a matter of a few seconds as the third light was getting brighter.

The sky was clear with just a few scattered clouds. I had originally gone out to see what was happening, as about an hour earlier, a pair of Blackhawk helicopters were circling the area, extremely low with only their battle lights on.  I ended up looking at the stars after they left.  At 2152 hrs I noticed what seemed to be a satellite approaching from the south, about 30 degrees above the horizon. It was moving rather slow for a satellite and moving towards the northwest.  It started as a dim white color but began increasing in size and intensity.  Just when I thought I was about to see a good iridium flare, I realized that instead of flaring and then subsiding, this object was continuing to increase in size and brilliance.  It became huge, larger and brighter than Saturn visible to the west, and the color was now an unusual shade of light green around the edge and brilliant white in the center.  It appeare! d to be self-illuminated and not reflecting the sun.  It remained at its brightest for several seconds, then it suddenly went completely dark for a fraction of a second, then returned with full brilliance.  Concurrent with this display, I noticed a small, white object shooting off to the west at a slight downward angle.  The white object looked like a small, very slow meteor leaving a short trail.  It appeared slightly below the green object and quite a bit to the right of it, but the trajectory of the white object in relation to the green object gave me the impression it had shot out from it. (It is possible that it was just a meteor as there was nothing unusual about it other than its appearance and proximity to the green object.)  The green object, after re-appearing, remained illuminated for a about a second, then rapidly diminished in size and became completely dark. It did not just blink off but seemed to &quot;power down.&quot;At 2202 hrs., I saw a two more objects one after another, almost directly overhead going from south to north. They performed similarly to the large green object, but did not become as bright and they remained white in color.  They too grew in intensity, flashed on and off several times and then went dark.  I checked the Heavens Above website and discovered that there were NO iridium satellites visible from my location on that date, and the other known objects that were visible were not overhead at the times or locations of these sightings.}"

My roommate was in the car (passenger seat), but he did not see anything, and I kept asking him if he saw it, and he said no.  It was only one object I saw.I grew up around the space center in Clear Lake, Texas, and have seen shuttle launches in Florida when I was a kid, and my best description is if a shooting star had a bit of a trail that disappeared as soon as it was made.  It was traveling South to North, and was too bright and constant to be a star, along with being too big.  It flew just behind some clouds, continued on and then disappeared.I do not know what to make of this, but this is not the first time I have seen something weird in the sky here in Montana.  I Arrived in Bozeman December 23rd, 2009, and last Friday (July 16th) I saw a very strange object in the sky that I mistook for a star, until it moved, leading me to believe it was a plane, but then it moved in very tight curves and zig-zagged.  After about 1 minute it disappeared, but then I could only see it with peripheral vision, and could not observe it if I looked directly at it.  My roommate was outside with me as well, and witnessed and confirmed the object, it&apos;s movement, and then it only being observable with peripheral vision.After tonight&apos;s incident, I checked online for other stuff like that, and came across your website.

My two nephiews and I were walked up to the roof to watch the amount of Yankee fans that came for the Old Timers Game.  Sure enough, as I last stated here back in July of (I think it was 1999), we witnessed them again, the first one appeared to us like fire directly above our heads it just spun around in a circular motion then just disappeared. The second seemed like a star but it was too high up to say anything about it and was moving very rappidly also not in a steady motion.The third was astonishing. It was amazing but we were not surprised due to the fact we saw them before plenty of times just spending time up on roof-tops. It was close to the Supreme Court&apos;s roof just hovering straight across in a very slow-motion.It was an oval egg-shaped like object, about the size of a full-sized van and an orange or fire like color to it with no shine or light, just creeping across the sky.What got us was that about 3 minutes to the direction it headed towards there appeared to be a crime scene.  All of a sudden a Police helicopter flying in circles around the area and about 20 Police cars.Then we saw a fourth heading towards the same direction but this one appeared to be white.   A fifth was coming behind him, this was to the left of us while the other to the right of us.  This one startled us a little because it was very close, seemed to be coming towards us at head level then it rose up at about 50 feet above our heads, this one was very clear to us.  It was definatley oval, saucer like, with two blue lights going around in circles on the top center of it.  The lights were not bright at all, perhaps they weren&apos;t lights.  It then changed shape, seemed like two legs came out the backside of it then it crumbled like liquid metal and again back to it&apos;s solid shape and headed to the same direction as the other four.Five minutes had past and the sixth appeared behind us this time above the Yankee Stadium heading straight towards our direction also at head level and slowly towards the last fives&apos; direction.  Then about two minutes later, five in a V shaped formation headed straight across the sky for about ten seconds and just vanished before our eyes, again towards the same direction as the last six before them.I stopped wrighting to the National Ufo Reporting Center because I wasn&apos;t getting any answers.  I was going through a lot of great disturbing confusion and wanted to point the finger at all the wrong places.  Instead I decided to ask, what ever I was looking at, for answers.  This is all I wanted to share for now, it makes no sence what-so-ever for me to dwell into this because the life experiences I have had lead me to believe and understand that folks all over the world will always be blinded by the truth and wouldn&apos;t believe it if these crafts were pointed out to them.  Yet a large amount of us believe and preach that there is a God but don&apos;t have enough faith to understand the huge fact that heaven is directly above our heads, in space, there are millions of angelic and demonic beings, or just normal like you and I, watching over us or just living their lives out there in different worlds.  We don&apos;t have all the answers as facts because we all need to find faith in order ! to get the answers we want or wait untill we die.  That&apos;s what makes us God&apos;s favorite creation, remember that we are a creation from above.  I searched for many answers during my first experiences and I found many answers with nobody&apos;s help.  There will be a time when they will reveil themselves to us with or without the approval of our so-called-leaders.If you believe what I am saying and search for aswers using faith from God then they have a special place for you.}"

They could not spot it.The light was the size and brightness of an average star you would see in the night sky only it was moving steadily in the blue sky in a westward direction towards Lake Erie.  As I was trying to show my brother where it was it gradually vanished, this could have been from cloud cover but it was clearly visible moving through other clouds near where the Moon was in the sky.  It appears that when I first saw the object, it was flying below the clouds.There was no trail like what you would see from an airplane, the object was high in the sky but appeared to be a white orb or light.  Moving at that speed and distance I would rule out that it was a high flying seagull which would have a different shape and not be as bright.  The weather conditions at the time were clear, no excessive humidity.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

There was also a smaller red dot light above it.The object was moving slightly north and coming from the south.  It then began to move to the west and slightly to the south again.  After about three minutes total it was too far for us to see anymore because there were trees in the way.I compared the object to air planes and helicopters around the area after the sighting and it was larger and not comparable to the lights of our aircraft.

The sky was visible through the breaking clouds and at times the stars and the partly full moon was visible.   When the clouds rolled across the highline electrical grid it caused some disturbance and made an object temporary visible though the breaking clouds.  The object that was hiding above (or inside) the clouds was temporary visible until it passed the electrical power lines.    This object was black but it appeared like it was shorting out because there where green flairs sparking around it.

It was during the late fall or early winter of circa 1970 in Newton Centre, Massachusetts.  The time was about 9:00 p.m. and it was a clear moonless night, no wind but cold.  As I was adjusting the telescope mount, my friend said, &quot;Look at that!&quot;  I looked up and between a large clearing in the trees was an object silently gliding across the sky at about 45 degrees above the horizon out of the NNE heading in a southerly direction  The object had the shape of a pie pan being viewed from edge on or in other words a trapezoid geometry.  It was tipped up almost vertical (maybe leaning 10 degrees to the right) with the shorter base of the trapezoid on the right and the longer base of the trapezoid on the left.  The length of the longer base was about the diameter of a nickel held at arms length.

The object made no noise nor emitted any visible exhaust trail as it glided across our view.  Interestingly, it did appear to interact with the air as its movement was one of a wallowing as if it were spilling air as it moved along.

I watched this for 10 to 15 minutes, then craft went up at least 2000ft and then started moving to the north west as it picked up speed.  The craft seem to be in the 40 to 50 ft range; tall. I could tell because it was fairly close to the TV towers, each painted section is 100 ft so I could gauge this a bit.

After so much information became public I started to mention it.In the fall of 1978 I was working at the China Lake Naval Weapons Center and living on the military base.  As a friend and I were entering the rear gate, I looked over at him and something caught my eye.  I told him and he looked over and saw it too.  We pulled off the road onto the dirt shoulder and saw a car behind us also pull over.  We sat there for maybe 10 min. and watched this saucer type UFO (rounded dome on both top and bottom and the saucer type middle) hanging over the middle of town.  An illuminated cloud surrounded it.  After a while, it all of a sudden swooshed back really fast heading south west it just flew faster than anything we had in 1978 or now.  The illuminated cloud hung there for quite a few minutes the cloud dissipated and was gone. The Gentleman I was with and I talked about what we saw.  We both saw the exact same thing.  I&rsquo;m assuming the car behind us saw the same thing since we both did.  Being a small town I expected something would be published in our local newspaper but it never was.  After so long of not finding it in the newspaper I decided to put aside and not mention it.  Our town at that time had maybe 12000, 13000 people and some one other than us must have seen it.In 1996 while still living in Ridgecrest I was headed west on hwy.178 and then south on hwy.14 to pick up 178 again after a few miles.  While I was climbing up the hill a light caught my eye.  It was speeding fast and was a completely round bright light.  I watched as it went behind the peaks and then into the clear and then back behind the next peak.  OK, I feel really stupid seeing two UFO&rsquo;s in my lifetime but I did. I still remember the name of the man I was with and know where he went back to his hometown.  He was a very nice honest person and so am I.  I would even be willing to take a lie detector test.  I visited Roswell NM in April and after seeing all of the information there I decided to inform someone. I&apos;m 65 yrs, old and not in great health.

It is several acres of park ground with an outdoor stage for concerts, etc. We were seated in lawn chairs on the west side of the park/stage area.  A few feet to the west of us is a street, on the other side of which is Addison Airport for small planes.  As part of the festivities there were flyovers by vintage war airplanes, circling the park area.  The wind section of the symphony was playing music on the stage as the vintage planes occasionally circled the park.  Our chairs were facing the stage, a few yards to our southeast, with the airport behind us.  I do not know the time, but it was still light, approximately 8- 8:30 pm.I happened to notice and began to watch something bright orange, somewhat circular in shape, approaching from the behind the stage (from the south) travelling in a straight line to the northwest, crossing over the Addison airport.I pointed it out to my friend and we both watched as a 2nd object appeared behind the first one.  The two objects flew silently in a straight line from south to northwest.  There was nothing unusual about the flight pattern, only that they were bright orange and that I had never seen anything of that color before, and that they were somewhat circular in shape.The vintage planes had been flying at a lower altitude where you could clearly see their shape.  The two orange objects were a lot higher in the sky, but low enough to appear an approximate 4 inch diameter as we viewed it.  They moved quickly.  Our line of sight was about a mile, and it took a couple of minutes for them to disappear from view.We both watched and commented about it. I made a joke that maybe it was ufo&rsquo;s for our 4th of July festivities. They were definitely not airplanes as we know them.I have never seen any kind of ufo before and I didn&rsquo;t think any more about it until I heard your report on Coast to Coast that there were many such sightings on July 4, and I mentally noted that we had seen these objects on July 3, but at a July 4 celebration.There were several hundred people at the event, but I only know of my friend and I who actually watched these 2 objects.}"

It was a clear night and the stars where out, no fog or clouds.  Then a very large craft came over the trees, I was very scared and thought &apos;what if I&apos;m abducted&apos;.  I pulled my car over so as not to draw attention to myself.  It was massive, about the width and length of a football field.  The shape reminded me of one of those Star Wars big star ships like the one at the beginning of the 1st episode but it didn&apos;t have a large top area, it was smooth and triangular, at the end it had 3 very large round engines just like the Star Wars ship.   The color was identical to the sky, when it went over me it blacked out the stars but looked like a hole in the sky because of the color match.

We were in the grass next to the lake and a playground.  7 of us in my family saw a bright orange fireball moving across the sky from the south to the north about 3-5000 feet above the ground.  There was a lighter foggy border around it but all you could really see was fire underneath the object, which was unseen due to the dark night sky.  It was about the size of Mars when it&apos;s closest to the Earth.  The object was seen for about 10-12 minutes and then went behind a cluster of trees and wasn&apos;t seen again.

As I headed back into my house, I noticed an extremely bright light in the sky behind my house.  I was immediately struck by the brightness of the object because it had just turned dark.  I observed it for a moment or two, wondering if it was a planet.  When I realized that there were no other stars in the sky yet, I became more intrigued.  I, therefore, decided to observe it longer.  5 minutes turned into 10 minutes, and I called my husband outside to ask him what he thought it was.  He first thought it was a planet or the &quot;north star,&quot; but as he observed it longer, he thought it was &quot;a little strange.&quot;  The light was not moving and made absolutely no sound. After approximately 10 minutes, my husband decided to go back into the house.  I, however, remained transfixed, and continued my observation for approximately 30-40 minutes longer before I decided to go ba! ck into my house to get my camera.  At approximately 9:15-20 p.m., I took photos of the light.  During the entire 40-45 minutes of my constant observation of this light, it remained in relatively the same spot in the sky.  [It is important to note that we live less than one mile away from the Mercer County Airport and literally see planes landing on the runway (running west to east) through the trees in our backyard. This light, however, was directly north, and during my observation of this light, continued to see planes fly in front of it.]   As I began to take pictures of the light (which visually remained static) I noticed that when I found it in my camera viewfinder the object appeared to be MOVING very rapidly in a haphazard way.  When I moved my eyes away from the camera to observe the light, it appeared perfectly still to my eyes! I took 8 pictures of the light on May 15th.  After I took my 8 pictures, the light simply disappeared. During my observation of the light, I was ! not frightened, simply intrigued and highly curious about what! I was o bserving.  It is also important to note that I was seeking some confirmation that it might be an airplane flying south, however, at no time did I observe flashing beacon lights.The light appeared again in the same relative spot in the sky on Sunday, June 6th, 2010 at approximately 8:00 p.m.  My husband and I were returning home and I noticed the same very bright light as I got out of our car.  It was earlier than the previous 5/15/10 sighting, and the sky was somewhat lighter.  Again, there were no other observable stars yet in the sky, thereby highlighting the intensity and oddness of this particular light.  I immediately retrieved my camera and took 7 pictures of the light. I observed the light intermittently (i.e., I kept coming outside from the house to check on it rather than strictly observing it as I did on 5/15) for approximately 40 to 50 minutes.  Just as in the first sighting, the light remained static (to my eye) and remained in the same relative position in the sky. The final time I checked, it was gone (approximately 9:00 p.m. or so.)   Since my two sightings of this intense light (and subsequent review of my pictures), I am HIGHLY curious about it and am hoping that someone can explain what it is to me.  I now find myself looking for the light every night, but have not seen it since the 6/6/10 sighting.  Further, I did check the flight data on the ISS, and it was nowhere near my position in New Jersey on either 5/15/10 or 6/6/10.((NUFORC Note:  If in the NW sky, probably Venus.  PD))}"

As usual, after getting out of the car, I stood there a while and look at the stars.  I was looking N/E and caught a flicker to the East.  I looked and saw, what I can only describe as, a fireball.  It was moving so slow that I actually watched it for about 30 seconds.  30 seconds!  It was moving easterly on a steady path and had a faint, but visible tail.  Whatever its distance was from my eyes, I can assuredly say that it looked the size of the full moon.  I could actually see movement in the color probably due to excessive heat. It was kind of like looking straight into a jet&rsquo;s afterburners.It was either a HUGE object or it was very, very close.  From my viewpoint, it looked like it was at a level where I would normally see jets coming in for a landing, but I&rsquo;m sure that was just an optical illusion.I saw nothing coming off the object like pieces or sparks.  It was round, clean and almost photoshopped-looking except for the faint pinkish spray of the tail.If this was a meteor, it was far too close for my comfort and there was nothing at all mentioned on the news.This is the second time I&rsquo;ve seen something like this. The first time, in the late 70&rsquo;s, was not nearly as spectacular, but just a thrilling.  As we were driving back from Newport Beach at 3:00am, that object went right over our heads, like a plane going down, then shot up at a very sever angle and out of sight, all in about 10 seconds.  No sound at all. Neither of us talked about it.  The people in the car driving next to us also saw it.  I looked over at them and they just shrugged.If I were to have taken a picture of either object it would have looked exactly like the gas bubble (without the fiery outer layer and red tail) on the &lsquo;In the News&rsquo; section of the C2C website, under &quot;Black Hole blows huge gas bubble.&quot;I&rsquo;ve never seen ball lightening in California. In any case, I doubt it would be as big as these objects.I am a Staff Assistant for an Engineering of a Municipal utility.  I worked in the aerospace industry for 10 years, loving my company and every minute of work.  I have been intrested in everything to do with space, planets, astronomy,and etchnology since I was 1st grade - all due to a large panaramic picture my teached had posted on the Science Wall that dipicted the birth and death of planet Earth.  I didn&apos;t quite accept that particular concept of Earth, but it was colorful.I keep binoculars in my car just so I can look at stars.  (Unfortunately I wasn&apos;t about to take my eyes of the May object to grab the binoculars.I now keep them under the front seat.)   I often get up at two or three in the morning just to go outside and look at the sky.  It&apos;s very calming, but somewhat hard on my neck.  I&apos;ve seen a lot of extremely interesting things up there that, and that just keeps me hooked.If you keep looking down, you might find money, if you keep looking up, your discoveries can be priceless.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

20100704,7/4/2010,20100709,7/9/2010, Derby, KS,KS,USA,Midwest, other,"Around 2-3 hours, off and",#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,"Formations of glowing and non-glowing spheres hovering over a Kansas city.Of course, this 4th of July involved fireworks. Note that what I am reporting as &quot;fireballs&quot;, &quot;glowing lights&quot;, or hovering spheres, are not the likes of any firework which I am familiar with.Around 9:15 p.m., a friend and I sat on my back porch watching fireworks displays from various neighborhoods around us.  We set off a few of our own, but nothing big.  Neither of us had any alcoholic beverages that day or night, nor do we do drugs; our states of mind were as sharp and relaxed as possible.When looking south, during a lull in the fireworks, we both noticed (and promptly pointed out to each other) 4 objects in the dark sky.  We were looking at about a 35 degree angle of elevation.  The objects seemed to hover in place, making only minuscule adjustments to hold formation due to strong winds.  They glowed with an orange-red light, the closest approximation of which I can make is the HTML Hex code #CC1100.  It was not an extremely strong glow, in that I could not see it illuminating any objects on the ground, trees, or even that much of the smoke present from the fireworks.  However, it was clearly bright enough (or close enough) to reach my friend and I with no problem.  They were arranged in what looked from our viewpoint to be the shape of a rhombus or diamond shape, but I cannot say for sure due to our angle and imperfect depth perception concerning their distance from one another.  They seemed to act together, as though they were all present for the same cause or of! the same force.Other similar formations could be seen from the front of my home looking northward; one directly north and one in the north-northwest.  The latter formation was at a greater distance from us, causing the glows to appear smaller and sort of blend together, creating uncertainty on the number in that formation.  We could only assume that there were also four there, as this is how the others were arranged.The formation to the south was still closest to us, and we mainly observed it.  It remained still, emitting no beams or objects, but the objects seemed to alternate positions every 45 min. or so.  About 5 min. after a rotation, the object closest to us (on a the point of the rhombus) darted towards us significantly. It hovered now above the pond directly behind my house.  It faded in color and luminescence as it neared, becoming completely matte black by the time it reached us.  It hovered there, and had it not been for fireworks on the horizon and city lights illuminating the haze, it would have blended easily into the night sky.  We had a Nikon D5000 with an external flash and telephoto lens, and immediately started fumbling for it to try to capture it on camera.  The camera would not boot up.It usually takes about half a second to turn on and become ready to shoot, if that.  But it wouldn&apos;t. The battery was charged, for we tried two of them, both of which had been charged that day.  It was in the right way and there should have been nothing to interfere.  In the dark, I tried to use my lighter to see if there was some fault or something that could prevent it from working.  It was a push-button or electronic butane aerosol lighter, where one clicks a button down, creating a spark, and igniting a jet of butane fuel.  The fuel came out as usual when the button was depressed, but the spark would not work. Neither would my friend&apos;s.We took this to mean that after going into some sort of less detectable mode, it also activated a device that shut down certain electronic capabilities within a reasonable proximity.  Unable to capture it, we could only stand in awe.  It looked to be about 15 ft. in diameter, and rotating a bit in one direction before reversing its spin. It spun fairly slowly, almost like it was just drifting there.  After about 3 min. of suspension, it flew back to its formation.  It did not change color, but by the time the craft got back, the formation was then the same shade of matte black.  It was unbelievable how...black it really was. It seemed to just suck in all light.  There were minor indentations around the craft, visible when not luminous, around the &quot;equator&quot;.  Just short dashes, impressed into the material. This allowed us to notice the rotation before.After reforming, the formation flew northward at unnatural speeds.  There was no time for acceleration. It was just...going.  It went from a stop to its desired speed immediately and remained steady at that speed until arriving near the northern formations.  They joined to form a loose squarish shape. This larger formation flew northward while gaining altitude at a steady pace.  I can&apos;t imagine why only the one formation would go into its &quot;undetectable&quot; or stealth mode while in the larger formation, but it remained that way during its exit.My friend has done no real research into ufology or related fields, and previously was just oblivious.  He had no opinion.  He always took a tolerant, but non-believing, attitude towards matters like this. I have read numerous books, online articles, and viewed a vast amount of serious multimedia on the subject, including photographs, video recordings, and audio clips.  I don&apos;t consider myself to be a serious researcher by any means, but I do take matters of this nature seriously.}"

I was looking in the direction that the flash appeared to originate from, in the southwest portion of the sky near Douglas Park, (a new commercial and housing development near the Long Beach Airport) and saw a vibrant but undiscernible arc or point of green light low in the sky, slightly above the rooftop level of a house across the street. One friend of mine, who was facing the other direction, also saw the flash but observed that it lower in intensity and appeared to have come from behind him.Several friends of mine living in an area in the general direction of the flash--in the Lakewood Country Club--reported having lost power at the time, several minutes later via facebook. The flash event lasted only a brief second, and neither I nor my companions heard any sort of noise in the seconds following the anomaly.I suspect that the flash was caused by a copper or thallium-containing iron meteorite, which would explain the green color of the flash, the lack of accompanying sound, and EMP which knocked out power.  I am an entering college student with an above-average scientific background.  I wrote this report to provide a coherent, detailed explanation of the event that occurred in anticipation that other reports would be made.}"

I am quite accustomed to seeing satelites, shooting stars and assorted aircraft, but last night was different.  I live outside of town and am very secluded.  The nights are gorgeous since there is no light polution.  I sat outside for about half an hour and was able to track several satelites.  I had just finished tracking my last satelite, watching it disappear above me over my house.  I immediately dropped my eyes back down to the horizon, looking southeast.  There is a large hill in front of where I live and it is covered in small pine.  Suddenly above the treeline appeared what I first thought was a star.  It hadn&apos;t been there a minute before.  It shown intensely bright, and I could not figure out what star, at that intense a magnitude, would be coming up in that place at that time.  It was way brighter than anything else in the sky.  I continued to think it was a very! bright star when I suddenly realized it was moving very, very slowly.  Then I got excited and thought perhaps I was looking at the ISS.  I have no idea how high it was, and there was no noise connected to it.  I watched it for about a minute as it traveled about the length of my hand - if I were to extend my arm.  It suddenly stopped, unlike anything I have ever seen.  It hung motionless and grew even more intense in its brightness, and then began to slowly dim until it became just a pin point of light, and disappeared.  The only way I can describe the object is that of a very bright, white light - like a huge star.  I have never seen anything act that way.  I would be curious to know if anyone else saw the same thing.}"

They were winking on and off intermittently (no rhythm to the intervals)  and appeared to be changing location slightly from their formation. They were just above the southern horizon in respect to my location which is in the Uniontown area just south of the Hartville flea market..I proceeded to wake my wife up and she then witnessed the event. We watched the objects hover until&rsquo; about 6am, when they appeared to disappear over the horizon.

There was a plane in the sky, far away enough to just look like a white spot, but close enough to see it&apos;s lights, red and white I think.  And it was leaving a white trail behind it, like normal planes do. It looked like a typical commercial aircraft.  But below it, there was another object.  It looked like a white spot in the sky. It had no lights at all, and it wasn&apos;t leaving any kind of trail behind it, yet it was keeping up the same exact speed as the plane.  We watched it for awhile trying to decide what we were looking at, and eventually I decided to run inside and get my camera.  By the time I got back outside, the UFO was in front of the plane quite a bit, and too difficult to locate through the lens of my camera. We never got a good shot.This reminded me of another sighting I had witnessed a week or so before.It was in the same area of the sky, and also in broad daylight.  Again, I was on the porch smoking, and a small flash in the sky caught my eye.  When I looked up, there was nothing there. I watched for awhile to see what might have caused it, and a couple seconds later I saw it again, what it looked like to me was something (that I couldn&apos;t see) was reflecting the sun.  That&apos;s all it was, a bright white reflection that lasted a few seconds.  Disappeared, Re-appeared, and then was gone. I wasn&apos;t looking through a window, or anything, so I don&apos;t know what was reflecting the sunlight, but there was very obviously something up there.A few nights after that incident, my husband and I heard a helicopter really loud outside our house, he went to see, but I stayed in front of the TV..  He explained he saw what looked like a military helicopter, because of it&apos;s green color, flying around the vicinity of our house.  The strange thing though, is that it had a search light on, and instead of searching the ground, it was searching the sky.All of these things happened just within the past 2 weeks. I decided it was one two many incidents to not mention anything.}"

I watched it because it was unusually large and near to the earth.  The object suddenly began to fade away at a rapid speed and then turned red and disappeared altogether. Later that night, I saw four or five other bright objects zoom through the sky at an insane amount of speed.  Some of the objects would disappear and then reappear and others would turn from gold to gray.  At about 3:00am on the 8th of July I saw a brilliant light that appeared to be a golden magnetic energy rise from the earth until about two hundred feet off the ground at which point it stopped emitting the gold light and began to blink in a manner very similar to a commercial jet.  The object then blinked a pattern of red, green and blue lights, turned in my direction and then flew over my head.  I was unable to discern its shape.  It then flew away and as the distance between it and me increased, the blinking lights made the object look like a shimmering star.  But if you scrutinized it closely, you could tell it wasn&rsquo;t a star, but some form of advanced technological cloaking device.  Then I noticed there were other &ldquo;stars&rdquo; in the sky that blinked in a similar fashion.  As I watched these objects, some of them moved slowly through the sky, while others zoomed at very high speeds.  Then they objects would settle down again and mimic the stars.July 8th 2010, Dusk.Due to the prior night&rsquo;s events, I found a good viewing spot (the top of a hill in Wedgewood) and began watching the sky much earlier. From this vantage point I witnessed hundreds of these &quot;stars&quot; crept across the firmament and descended ever so slowly from the real stars to earth.  They moved so slowly that if I hadn&rsquo;t been anticipating the event and patiently watching, I never would have noticed. But I did notice.  And as the ships reached Earth the sun went down.  But just before it was totally dark, I caught a brief glimpse of one of these ships.  To my surprise it resembled a very sophisticated space-plane. It hummed soothingly.  The other ships then came in my direction traveling slow and low, but keeping their lights in a fashion as to mimic commercial jets.  Occasionally the light pattern would change into a sudden brilliant display of undulating red, green, blue and gold lights.  The ships then circled around Seattle for an hour or so, at which point some of them scattered! out in all directions, while others settled in the sky and mimicked the stars.  I stayed up all night watching the ships that remained.  Some had three lights and appeared to be triangular; others had four lights and appeared to be square. I got some footage with my cell phone.  But the quality is pretty low.  Also, they knew when I was about to take a picture because almost every time I raised my camera, they would change from what they were doing with the lights back to a commercial jet pattern.  I talked out loud and it was as if they could hear me.  For a while nothing particularly obviously out of this world happened. So I said, &quot;Okay, I&rsquo;ll but my camera away.&quot;  Then the ship nearest me did a good deal of rapid blinking and all of a sudden, to the south, I saw a golden light arise over Capitol Hill.  It neared me. When it flew past, I saw that it was another ship that had just come in.  Then I walked home and went to bed.}"

The light intensity was steady, never flickered or changed intensity at all.  It never deviated in elevation as it came overhead and passed over us. We were almost under it.My one daughter was actually crying it was so odd.  The thing that baffles me most....I never saw anything like it before.

Me and my wife are avid sky watchers and definitely know what meteors, satellites, planes, ISS etc looks like. This defies explanation to us.What we saw, and we were CLOSE to it.... was a bright round orange light inside what seemed to be a perfectly round glass sphere...  I guess that would be my best description.  I would guess...and this is just a guess based on my experience...to be around 7-8 ft in diameter.  Perhaps what seemed to be a glass sphere surrounding the ball of light could&apos;ve actually been just the &quot;flare&quot; effect of the bright light.Also.... we had a county fair going on that night.....but this came from a direction that it couldn&apos;t possibly have came from the fair...I&apos;m puzzled to explain it.}"

Also, when we looked up we couldn&apos;t really see what color the actual flying object was, but it had a green square colored light on the bottom of it.

On our way home as we came to the end of our street was a big very bright hovering craft over a telephone pole. I remember saying Oh my gosh look! and we all looked as we came closer to the craft. There was no sound that I can remember but the brightest light I have ever seen.  The strange thing is, it was so profound yet I believe there is some time missing.  I am unsure what happened between the time we saw it and when I arrived home. We never talked about it together again.

20100704,7/4/2010,20100705,7/5/2010, North Bend, NE,NE,USA,Midwest, unknown,Minutes,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,"&quot;Burning&quot; flying object passes at least 3 times east of North Bend, Nebraska, USAObject sighted:  Yellow-orange flying object which appeared to be &quot;burning&quot; from the quality of the light.Location:  North Bend, Nebraska, USA  Direction:  East Angle of view:  Approximately 30 degrees above the horizon.My family and I spotted a flying object flying almost exactly north, in the sky east of North Bend, Nebraska. The sighting took place on July 4th, 2010.  My wife and I were lighting fireworks in the back yard of her parents&apos; house when suddenly the people at the house started talking and pointing to the east.  They called out to me, &quot;What is that?&quot; I saw a light moving far in the distance. Initially I thought it was a helicopter because the light seemed to flicker, like the flame of a candle.  However it was high and very fast and the light seemed to be one of burning, and not an electric halogen bulb like you see on modern aircraft.  Additionally, there were no red and white strobe lights that are standard on regulation aircraft (we could clearly see these on commercial aircraft passing at cruising altitude high overhead).  It continued north (it had first been spotted to the southeast of us), and the light didn&apos;t really change as our perspective of it did as it passed (i.e., there was no dimming effect like you might get from headlights passing you as the craft eclipses its lights, etc.).It was flying quickly, at least the speed of a large helicopter or a plane. After a minute or so it was across the sky, and northeast of us, when it rather quickly faded out of sight entirely. This was surprising to us because we were seeing commercial jets far over head and could clearly make out their blinking red and white lights over an altitude of at least 15,000 feet.The object (or a second one, identical to the first) appeared again about 15 to 20 minutes later, again in the southeast.  It followed the exact same flight pattern as the previous, vanishing again in what we can say at best was the same spot as before.A third and identical sighting took place roughly an hour after the first one.  By the third time it came around, we had gone inside to get some binoculars. The object was difficult to focus on, but the characteristics of the light coming from the object was more akin to the flame of a candle than the steady shine of an electric source.  I&apos;d say it was about 10 times brighter at least than the brightest star in the sky at that point, and perhaps three times the diameter of any of the stars.  My father in law was able to track it in his binoculars, and describes that it seemed like a round object, like looking at a disc on its side or perhaps a sphere, with the burning light coming from around the perimeter of the circumference.All in all, the sightings took place between 10:00 pm and 11:00 pm, US Central time.There were 6 adults and 2 young children at that house, and we all saw it each time.  After the third one, my father-in-law and I went next door to see if the neighbor had seen the same thing.  She and her two grandsons had seen it during one of the fly-overs.  She thought at first that it was a basket from a hot air balloon, saying that the light&apos;s quality made her think of the hot air generator present in such balloons. But she quickly realized it was moving far too fast to be a balloon.The object&apos;s trajectory was more or less level across the sky, parallel to the ground for an apparent distance of several miles, except at the end it could possibly have been increasing altitude, but hard to say without any precise measurements.The following day (July 5th), we communicated with some family who live in Wichita, Kansas, and they saw the same object flying in the same direction.Though the light was the brightest thing in the sky (the moon was not visible at this time), we heard no sound from the object on any of the three passes, only the sound of fireworks across town.  Also there was not much wind that day, so the object(s) appeared to have had to be flying under their own power.}"

The size I would say was 3 &ndash; 4 times bigger than the planet Venus which is now prominent in the night skies. These 2 objects appeared to be at the same altitude but we could tell there were two separate objects.As they got closer to us, they appeared to slow down. There was no sound coming from these objects which really got us wondering what these were. The objects stopped moving completely for about 5 to 10 seconds then they both started moving slowly upward and we watched them disappear into the clouds.The weather conditions were windy because thunderstorms were in the area.

The three orbs all seemed to be similar in size.  They made no noise I could hear from the freeway.

A forested area surrounded the end of the street. I was sitting in a lawn chair watching fireworks down on the street (the neighbors yard was up on a small hill), when I noticed something coming across the sky from the east. I knew it was far too high to be a firework, and the object was getting brighter as it got closer. It was coming what I perceived as slowly, so at first I thought it was some kind of air plane.  I was just surprised at how bright it was getting and close to be a small plane, since it was too close to be a commercial jet.  I don&apos;t really remember much sound either, no engine sounds for sure.  When it finally reached us, I saw it was a circular craft.  It hovered right above the poplar trees at the end of the street where we were all gathered!   Amazing, I was really amazed since my father watched Star Trek and being so young I was thinking it was something from the show....I could see the bottom of it, it hovered there with a very quiet sound, a quiet humming but not like any engine I had ever heard(boat,plane,car,tractor, ect).  It had different color lights on the edges on the bottom.  The lights circled around the perimeter of the bottom at equal distances. It hovered there for at least 15 minutes that I can remember.  It was close.  I&apos;m not good at estimating size, but I have a Ford F250 now, and you could fit three of them in the diameter of this craft easily.  The most amazing thing was its departure.  This is when reality hit me that this was not something from TV, even though I was only 6 or 7 years old.  It started to ascend upward, somewhat slowly, but then suddenly it just shot extremely fast straight up above the earth, and became just visible like a small star within just a few seconds, and then I totally lost view of it.

I remember thinking that it was funny that a car would pull out from this wooded area since there is no road or driveway.  It was very dark out but from driving this road every day.  I was aware that there were no roads on that side of the road.Suddenly, the orb which I had assumed was a vehicle light disappeared from behind me, but then noted in my passenger side mirror that this &quot;orb&quot; ( the color was slightly more yellowish than a clear headlight) was following directly to the right of my vehicle.  This &quot;orb&quot; followed me along the road for approximately 5 miles &quot;bouncing&quot; along the right  side of my car.  I also remember  thinking that it looked like the &quot;bouncing ball&quot; on the old  Mitch Miller show.  I then remember thinking maybe this was a UFO, but from anything I had ever seen on TV, this was not a UFO vehicle, and my radio was playing and the car was running so I  just couldn&rsquo;t figure out what this was.Then in the fall of 2004 ( October or November), I was again driving in the early morning, around 5: 15 a.m.,  I was driving south on Interstate 75 and was near the &quot;Kings Highway&quot; exit on the interstate, when suddenly to my left and up approximately 300 feet (estimate), I saw this very large plane like object.  It flew directly to the left of me and it looked like a large jumbo jet but without wings.  It was silent, and I saw no lights on this object.  I felt it was a plane that was about to crash because it was so low to the ground and now just 50-100 feet above the road and to my left.  It passed me and I looked in the mirror expecting to see a large explosion/smoke or some evidence of a crash but there was nothing.  I could no longer see anything as the sky was dark.  Again I did not lose any power to my car or radio.I picked up a co-worker in Punta Gorda and continued to travel south to Estero, Fl., that morning, and saw nothing more but did mention my sighting to my co worker, and she just laughed.We returned home the following night (Sunday) around midnight, and about 10 miles south of Punta Gorda, we both witnessed another bright &quot;orb&quot; like object high in the sky.  We watched this for about a minute and it didn&rsquo;t seem to move, then suddenly it was gone.  We did not see it move, it was just there one moment and gone the next.  Shortly afterwards as we were exiting the highway to return to her house, she looked at her watch and commented that it was much later than it should be  when we arrived back.  It seemed to take us approx 45 minutes longer to make the trip from Estero to Punta Gorda that night.I had kept these 2 &quot;sightings&quot; to myself all this time until I mentioned something to my sister in law recently, and it was she who said that round &quot;orbs&quot; have been reported in the past as UFO&rsquo;s.I then found your web sight for reporting any sightings, and felt that perhaps this may be significant, even though it has been quite sometime ago.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the dates of the two sightings are approximate.

The fact that we could detect flames even though it was so high up made us think the actual &quot;object&quot; had to be fairly large.

The lights were so bright that they left a residual light shadow in my sight when i closed my eyes like when you look at a flash and it stays with you for a while after.  I would have watched it all night long if the cloud deck did not block the view.  They were white with a tinge of blue and the left most light seemed brighter than the rest.  The light clouds that would obscure the lights from time to time helped me to see that this was a string of lights as opposed to one bright one.  The clouds are not uniform in their thickness and it would show as they passed how one end would be brighter and the other would be dim and successively the other would get dim and then bright depending on the shape of the cloud. Imagine a 747 about six miles out at 5000 feet coming right at you with landing lights on.  We see this quite often from our front yard.

More modern than anything that I can think of.My brother and I were on a 3 day vacation from work heading southbound to visit our mother in Fountain Valley, CA.  Starting our journey from Hayward, CA.  Accompanying us in the rental minivan were two other females. My brother and the other female sat in the back.  Approximately 2 hrs. north of Fountain Valley, CA (140 miles), on Interstate 5, I noticed a &quot;small airplane&quot; - with bright, but not blinding lights wobbling closely above the power line poles. My first thought was &quot;Just my luck, an airplane is about to land on me, or on the freeway ahead -- during my vacation...&quot; this lasted for less than one minute, within the next 10 seconds the &quot;airplane&quot; was on my left side (northbound of I-5) traveling steadily with the speed of my vehicle (70-75mph), in my direction, then the word &quot;ufo&quot; came to my mind, yet still skeptical, I called out to my brother, of whom I thought was sleeping, he replied &quot;I see it&quot; At this point my thought was: &quot;I must eliminate all other! possibilities&quot;.  I then rolled my window down to hear for any motor/engine noises, but only wind from my traveling vehicle was what I heard, then the craft at least doubled my speed, veered left, at least tripled my speed-that&apos;s when I clearly saw 3 white balls of lights in perfect linear formation, but for less than one second during its highest acceleration the middle &quot;ball of light&quot; became orangish, then white again during deceleration,then it made a fast and perfect u-turn and landed on a road of some sort.  Lights dimmed.   I had to get back to driving, so I turned my head towards front of my van again.  This all happened within 3-5 minutes.  I asked my brother, &quot;What was that?&quot; he didn&apos;t answer. I asked &quot;Was that a ufo?&quot;, he replied &quot;What else could it be?&quot;.}"

No discernable pattern in their positions.   I was heading southbound towards Milwaukee on I43, south of Grafton, passing Cedarburg, and approaching Mequon.  I saw about 20 lights to the east in a place where I had never seen lights before.  Seemed to be too high in the sky to be towards and too spread out.   I was focused on the road, but they appeared to be hovering.  No specific shape other than lights in the sky.   I kept glancing back as I passed and they remained. I took the Mequon exit and doubled back to head northbound again towards Cedarbug.  I saw that the lights remained.  I had my Iphone set to video mode, but had not begun to record as I wanted to pull over first.   I took the Cedarburg exit eastbound and pulled over and noticed 3 other cars pulled over as well.Although I was hesitant to, I called 911 to explain what I had seen, tried to switch to video mode on my Iphone, but could not.  By this point, I noticed closer to 7 lights slowly moving in a northbound direction, all lights still spread out in no specific pattern.  Got disconnected from the 911 call.A woman with her two teenage kids came up to me and mentioned that they could not get their Iphone to videotape this either.   As we were visiting over a couple of minutes, the lights were moving away and then just faded out.Sheriff called back, and asked that I wait to talk with one of their officers en route.  No one else had called to report this.I indicated 7 witnesses.  I believe there were more than likely over several hundred passive witnesses driving both northbound and southbound while this was occurring.These lights may have been in appearance for far longer than I had estimated.

I saw something reflecting in the sky that caught my attention and pointed it out to my husband.  It was traveling from East to West, was silver, and cigar or oval shape.  We kept discussing what we thought it could be, since we were intrigued by this &quot;thing&quot; in the sky.  There was no contrail from a jet/airplane and it seemed to be hovering at times, so we ruled out that option.  My husband then thought it could be the Space Station reflecting off the sun, so we called a friend who then went to the Space Station Tracking site.  He called us back and said the Space Station was not in our area at that particular time and the Space Station only travels from West to East.  During this time, my husband pulled over the truck so I could look through our binoculars, but I could never find the object when I used them.  My husband tried! as well, but our binoculars must not be that magnified.  We then continued on our way home, while following this object in the sky.

I thought it was hovering at a height much higher than consistent with commercial airliners landing or having just taken to the sky.I was standing at 1390 Grand View Drive in Berkeley and it seemed like the aircraft was directly above us.  The color of the aircraft was dark brown or black and shaped like a perfect cylinder, with neither any tapering at either end or anything resembling the wings of an airplane.  The end of the aircraft looked like the color chrome, but that may have been the sunlight glinting off of it.  Based on the altitude I estimate the aircraft was hovering at, it seemed like it&apos;s size was much larger than a commercial aircraft.After a few minutes, the aircraft reoriented itself from an original position consistent with the hull of an airplane flying horizontally to one flying vertically, while still holding almost the exact same position in the sky.

The object was cylindrical with bright white lights on the entire exterior of the craft and a flashing red light at the top of the object.  It continued in a northerly direction for approximately 5 seconds when it banked to a easterly direction.When the object banked you could see the object was cylindrical in shape.

It was twilight, just beginning to grow dark, and I saw what appeared to be a star in the sky.  I remember thinking to myself that it seemed to early to start seeing stars, and that this one was not only early but strangely bright.  And then, when I stopped at a stop sign, I realized it was moving.My first thought was I had mistaken a plane for a star, but it occurred to me that most planes blink, or have red lights.  This was an extremely bright, steady white light.  It wasn&apos;t moving extraordinarily fast, but it was moving pretty fast.  I heard no sounds (other than my own car&apos;s engine, with the window down on such a hot night) so I grew more and more curious as to what it was.Then, as my car began moving again, it simply faded away and was gone.  It didn&apos;t simply blink out, but seemed to fade off as if it was on a dimmer switch.  I could see nothing but blue-ish, darkening sky.  No clouds.}"

They continued eastward across the horizon, until my sight was blocked by tall trees and houses.  My first thought was that these objects might be hot air balloons because they seemed to hover/drift like hot air balloons.  Then, I realized that didn&apos;t make sense--they moved much faster than hot air balloons.  Since they appeared to be a fair distance away, I then assumed they might be planes from Portland airport or the military base nearby.  Although, I didn&apos;t know how far away they were, they seemed to be too close together to be planes (I&apos;m guessing 1-2 miles apart).  The color of these objects never changed, and no other lights or anomalies were seen.  Also, I never heard any sounds other than a few final fireworks going off or voices of our guests leaving.((NUFORC Note:  Evening sighting.  We have amended the time above, to reflect that fact.

But as we proceeded over the hill, we noticed that the light did not cast a beam, unlike a spotlight.

I have seen this phenomenon 5 times by myself over the past two months.  It does not occur every night. It always seems to be around 11:15 pm.  I called my husband and my eldest daughter to see it one other night.  The one time there was only one in the sky my daughter said she thought it was a geo satellite.  Each other time there have been only one or two of these lights in the sky.  They flash red, green, and white and are very high up in the sky.  They do not look like stars because the stars stay white and these flash the colors.  I have driven the area where I have often seen them looking for cell phone towers or RCMP communication towers and there are none in the area where they appear.  The objects are also too high in the sky to be on a tower.  They are too far apart and appeared in the NE part of the sky, SW part and the due W part of the sky.  So it can&apos;t be kids playing with balloons or anything l! ike that.  Besides balloons float upward and these stay stationary and only once have I saw one move.Tonight I saw the one very bright one and thought, it&apos;s back.  I smiled.  I noticed another one.  Then I saw a white light appear and flash very bright it appeared to be three times bigger than the stars nearby and then just disappear just near that bright one that had the flashing lights.  I called my husband.  He came out to see.  We counted eight of them in the sky in various areas.  My husband watched one move very fast and then seemingly disappear. He IS NOT a believer in UFO&apos;s.  I asked him if he thought small time Regina was so exciting that ANY government in their right mind would place 8 satellites overhead this often to observe US.  The google earth image stays daylight and had summer images in the winter time.  See I don&apos;t think we are THAT big of a priority here.  We do not have any special industries.  I just feel that we are NOT a likely target of any sort of massive government interest.  I called my mother in law and asked her to step out onto her balcony from! her place.  She did and she saw them too.  I said alright so it is now confirmed by some people other than me.  I am the only believer and both of you have seen them.  My youngest daughter and her cousin went outside to see what we were up to and they saw them too.Still in the sky at 12:39 pm.  The one that flashed the bright light has not reappeared and there are NO stars where it was when it flashed.  Regina does not typically have more than two commercial passenger airplanes at the airport at one time.  WE ONLY HAVE FOUR GATES IN our AIRPORT and only two luggage conveyors.  So it does not make sense that we would have 8 objects flashing red, green and white lights in our skies that sort of sit stationary for the most part and then move really rapidly once in a while.One night I tried to take a video or a picture of the brightest object assuming it was the closest to me but it did not show up on my camera as it must be too far away.  Perhaps my camera is just not good enough.The lights have now disappeared.  ALL OF THEM.   It is now 1:03am.}"

It was a saucer shape but made of rectangle shaped panels all around the sides flashing bright colors, as they described white, blue, yellow , red and green. While basically round, it had a &apos;jointed&apos; look to it.This was in the winter on a clear, moonlit night, and it had snowed recently, so the colors and craft were highly visible. In this area we have long tree rows which divide fields, and some of them are miles long.

I was looking at the sky facing south when my attention was drawn to a very bright reddish light low in the sky. It was about the size of a star, but it was the brightest thing in the sky. I watched if for about 2-3 seconds, before I realized it was obviously moving directly toward my position. It was getting visibly closer and appearing larger by the second.I called my son&rsquo;s attention to it, and he also saw it. By this time it was not quite directly over our heads. I got a very good look at it. It appeared to be a round ball of reddish orange flame.  It definitely had the appearance of flames, but there was no visible smoke or sparks. It was completely silent and moving in a straight line, south to north.  I saw no visible structure of any type. There was no noticeable wind blowing at the time.It passed almost directly over our heads. I turned around so I could continue to watch it as it passed by me on its way north.  After watching it for a few seconds now from behind it, I saw it make a little series of zigzag movements, right, left, then right left, again.  It then continued heading off to the north in a straight line until it disappeared from my sight.It was impossible for me to accurately estimate the speed, size, or altitude, in the dark sky. If I was going to guess based on my gut feeling, I feel it was smaller (less than 3 ft. in diameter), rather than a large object and at a few hundred feet elevation, rather than higher. It was moving quickly relative to its size.  The total time I watched it was about 20-30 seconds, maybe slightly longer.There are a couple of things I am sure it wasn&rsquo;t. It wasn&rsquo;t a firework, like a rocket or mortar. It was totally silent, slower, and left no trail. It also did not look like any flare I have seen either. It was not smoking, sparking, leaving a trail, or appear to be dangling from a parachute.}"

It was mostly white with a little trace of red on one side. It was way bigger than any star or planet or plane I had ever seen.  It wasn&rsquo;t blinking, and it didn&rsquo;t appear to be moving.   It stayed in one spot low in the horizon; I&rsquo;d say about twenty five to thirty degrees up.Baffled, I called my husband who was at home fifteen miles away in Springbrook, WI.  I asked him to step outside and tell me what the big object in the sky was.  When he asked me the direction, I replied, &quot;Don&rsquo;t worry, you will know when you see it.&quot;  It only took a few seconds to see what I was talking about. I asked him, &quot;What is it?&quot;  He replied, &quot;I don&rsquo;t know.&quot;When I arrived at home, he was still in our yard watching it through a brake in the tree line.  We watched for about 5 seconds, and then it dipped down and to the right about an inch in a swooping motion.  I gasped, completely shocked, &quot;Did that just move?!?!?!?&quot;  My husband replied, &ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s been moving the whole time.&rdquo;  We stood and watched this thing bounce around and move.  It dipped and dived and moved in small circles, almost as if we were watching someone flying a kite with a light on top of it, a kite you could see 20 miles away, with no wind.  Several times we had to move a few steps left or right because it would move behind the tops of the pine trees.We called our friend Dan who lives 8 miles west of us in Trego, WI.  When he stepped outside, he was stunned. When I was sure that we were not the only ones who could see it. I called 911.  I couldn&rsquo;t be sure that whatever it was, it wasn&rsquo;t dangerous.At about 11:00 it seemed to start heading down in the western horizon and it got gradually smaller, like it was going away from us. At 11:05, we couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore.It was a clear night and we could see hundreds of stars and satellites, and even an airplane flew by.  But none of them moved or looked like this.

My daughter went to get the dogs from outside to bring them in (she&apos;s 15) and she ran screaming &quot;get out a plane is going to hit us&quot; &quot;run&quot; and she was hysterical.  Me my husband and my son went running downstairs and my husband went to the backdoor (running) to investigate because my daughter is very meek and quiet and never screams.  The next thing I know my husband is yelling &quot;run&quot; &quot;its gonna hit us&quot; and he started praying to God that we lived and if not take us to Heaven.  We ran straight out the door as fast as our legs would go.  Myself and my son never heard or saw anything we were just running for dear life.  My husband told us to stop behind the trees because he thought at any moment it would hit and we wouldnt get much father and we live in the country so its all mostly open space.  When nothing happened he told us to keep running as I horrifyingly saw him turn back toward the house.  We kept going as we went trying to call our dogs that had escaped with us.  My husband returned in his truck to state the object simply vanished he had no idea where it went but it never hit our house or flew over us.  So we continued the search for our dogs however one was struck by a car and killed.  Later when I spoke with my husband and daughter I was informed it had 2 bright lights and was up in the sky they could see the back neighbors house below it and it made no sound and teetered a little back and forth but the lights were always horizontal to eachother.  This object made no sound what so ever and my husband said he saw the silhouette and it was as big as our back pasture across and very dark.  I am very saddened but wanted to report this because weird things have occurred before.  Like our laser lights we would play with our dogs with when we would point them in the field they would disappear at some points but would be seen all the way to the orchards at other points and we! always laughed that it was like something invisible was sucking up th e light at that spot. Im scared and wanted this reported in the case something happens to us.  Now it is time for me to grieve.}

Animated movie from prior sighting of 1997.We call this event &quot;The July Orb&quot; because we have witnessed this twice before, all in July.The event this year, 2010, was over Bothell, WA.  An orange, glowing orb silently and smoothly cruised from North to South in the same way a satellite would move, but was only as high up as a helicopter would fly. Myself, two other adults and two children also saw it.My camera was at the ready to photograph our fireworks and to pause light in the sky, and I was able to take a photograph!  The camera zoom is a 12x.  While the photo shows a tail, this is only due to the shutter being open as the orb moved.   The falling tail in the photo is due to me trying to find it to focus. Perhaps someone can figure out the size of this orb and it&apos;s speed based on these details!  Our neighbor came by and as I showed him the picture and explained what we saw he asked &quot;Do you mean like THAT!?&quot; Pointing up, there was the same thing, moving in the same direction.HISTORY Event 1: I first saw this same orb over Bothell WA, July 1997, and called Mr. Davenport to report it. I was so amazed that I created an animated version because it was hard for others to believe there was no other way to describe it other than a mystery object.  It also moved North to South, slowing and silently gliding.  However, the object was closer than the described 2010 event as I could see it pass behind trees in front of me.Event 2: July 2009, Couer D&apos;Alene Idaho, 11 or 12 pm.

This light had a red hue. Lasting about 5 seconds it crossed &frac34; of the sky until it disappeared into the distance.  I know it was not an airplane because it was traveling way to fast with no sound.  It was also not a weather balloon because of this factor also.  The conclusive factor I see in this is while as I was watching this light its trajectory curved.  As it crossed the night sky its path curved multiple times.  The curving was not dramatic but very noticeable and smooth. The curving path of this flying light factors out a meteor and a satellite.  Neither of these objects curve like the way this light did that night.  I also know that this light was not at the altitude of satellites because I have seen many satellites in the past and know they are very hard to see due to their high altitudes.}"

Even though we were driving on the freeway, they continued to pull further and further away from us.  Another reason that these objects could not have been parachutes was because they never came close to the ground.  Eventually, it seemed that some split off the the right of the freeway towards our house, and some went to the left of the freeway toward the Van Nuys area.  After we got off the freeway, we started to go up the hill that we live on, and I continued to look for any sign of the objects.

After walking for awhile we decide to lay down and relax for a bit in a nice grassy area.  It was a nice spot with many small trees well spaced apart.  Me and her were relaxing just talking looking up into the sky when I first spotted a group of lights.  I then pointed and said to her &quot;what&apos;s that?&quot; &quot;right there...that group of lights&quot; then I jokingly told her &quot;right there it&apos;s a UFO.&quot;  Of course she didn&apos;t believe and said something a long of the lines of &quot;no it&apos;s not!,&quot; but then 30 seconds later she spotted it as well.  So then for a good five minutes we watch the group of lights trying to talk out what it might be.(boy) The pattern of the lights is best described in my opinion is that of a school of fish swimming together. It was about 10 to 12 very dim lights in the very far distance (past the cloud line) moving around together in a very fluid motion.  The overall movement was not in a straight line, but as I said like a school of fish moving in a large circle.  Very fluid, very pretty, and very graceful movements.  The lights were very hard to keep track of, and we both had to strain our eyes to see it, but what we both saw is very consistent and unmistakable.(boy) Neither of us can say that we believe that is was aliens or anything to that effect, but what we did see doesn&apos;t a line with anything we&apos;ve seen before.  It could not have been a plane, helicopter, or satellite.  It was very foreign to us, and I thought it would be best to report while the event was still fresh in our minds.(Girl)  I don&apos;t exactly know how to describe what i saw because i have never seen anything that nearly resembles it.  To me it looked as if an invisible bubble that was nearly the size of the moon was containing a small group of 12 or so fire flies.  The light didn&apos;t move like fire flies, the movement of the light was so fluid and graceful. It was so hard to see the lights at times but once you had your eye on the lights it was unmistakable what you saw.  The lights almost looked red to me but I&apos;m not sure, just like dim stars look red sometimes.  The lights moved together in random patterns, but as they moved in their sphere they as a group moved in a circular movement.  The lights didn&apos;t flash at all they were completely solid unlike a plane light or like a twinkling star.  We watched it together and discussed what we saw for about three minutes until a cloud moved in front of the lights and then it was completely out of sight.  There was no sign of the lights through the ! clouds.  We sat for about a minute and were a little confused at what we saw and decided to get up and go home and tell my boyfriends family what we had seen.(Girl) While we had been watching the lights I had mentioned that we should call someone so that they could come outside and see what we had seen but then I realized that no one would be able to see it unless they knew where to look and also the light pollution is bad and we had been lucky enough to have stopped in a slightly dense area of trees.

As it flew over our house, we both noticed smaller lights that seemed to be circling around the larger light.  The smaller lights, to me, looked to be pink and green in hue (among other colors.)  I only got a clear look at it for a couple of seconds.We ran to the back of the house, out onto our deck, and watched as it flew slowly over the pine trees and over the neighborhood behind us.  Again, it didn&apos;t explode or diminish as fireworks might. It made no sound whatsoever.We ran inside and downstairs to inform my father, then ran back upstairs to watch it circling around and taking a similar path over the house for a second time.  I ran to get my camera, but the battery was dead.  I hooked up the family camcorder quickly so that it was pulgged into the wall and not running on a battery, but it was behaving strangely and kept shutting off.  We watched as the object disappeared over the house a second time.  I went to charge the other camera while my parents watched the object take its route over the back of the house again.  My father initially suggested it might be a flare, and then admitted he had no idea what it really was.My mother and I are confident we saw something out of the ordinary.  It was the moment when it was almost directly above us and we saw the smaller lights around the object that conviced us this was no typical 4th of July experience.}"

We were cresting a hill when I saw a strange bright orange/yellow glittering ball of light overhead just above the pine trees, high in the sky.  It was very bright, as bright as a planet I would say.  Certainly not as bright as an airplane might be.  The strange light moved away at a steady slow rate and we lost it.  We walked for minute more and then suddenly we saw it again!   It was coming back in the opposite direction!  We were so stunned by this we stopped to look at it and we definitely though this light was odd. It was glittering, bright orange and sometimes reddish in tint.  We just stood there and watched it move silently, and slowly.  It&apos;s flight was somewhat wobbly, even though it moved in a straight trajectory.  After about a minute it became very dim, only a pinprick of light and then it vanished completely.  Whatever it was, my sister was overjoyed she&apos;d seen a ufo but I on the other hand was pretty shaken up.  I&apos;ve never seen anything like that before!}"

The object was bright and was flashing red and green lights along with an almost L.E.D. white light. These lights were clearly visible to all three of us using just our eyes and later confirmed with binoculars and telescope. The object almost appeared to be rotating at high speeds which could explain to alternation of lights which had no apparent pattern. This object was relatively fixed in the same portion of the night sky compared to other celestial objects. The object would move in irrative movements, suddenly going to the left and right really fast and then in circular movements. Then, it stopped moving and the green and red lights settled down. I flashed a bright HID light at it in sequences of 3. It was like the object was reacting to my flashes by beginning to move again and flashing back once again. I couldn&apos;t believe what I was! seeing and neither could my astronomy buddies, we were all stunned.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

20100728,7/28/2010,20100730,7/30/2010, Chico, CA,CA,USA,West, triangle,4 min,4,240,short,"Triangle shaped formation of lights slowed and stopped, then changed direction and flew off.On the night of July 18, 2010 at around 10:00 pm in Chico, Ca, while walking home from the store, I witnessed what I thought at first was an airplane.  Upon looking at it closer I noticed that the light formation on it was different than the airplanes that I&rsquo;m so used to seeing. What caught my attention was that it was moving abnormally slow for an airplane, but on par with maybe a helicopter or blimp. For a minute, I thought it could be an ultra light aircraft, but it was completely silent.  Next I thought maybe the lights on the bottom of a blimp, but I have never witnessed a blimp in 15 years of living here.  My best guess was that it was triangle shaped, but it was very hard to make out with city lights around. This thing whatever it was made absolutely no noise.  It kept slowing down and finally stopped and sat there for about 10 seconds before changing course.  It was initially heading west but stopped and changed course to heading due north. When it changed direction it went straight over head.  As it flew over I tried to make out what it was.  It had three white lights in a triangle formation with one blinking red light in the middle with one additional slightly dimmer blinking white light mixed in.   The red light was slightly brighter than the rest of the lights. It didn&rsquo;t seem to be very far up at all, and it wasn&rsquo;t very big that I could tell.  Before it changed course, it was sort of near the moon I could make out sort of a roundish looking bottom to it, but only for a second. As it moved northward, it picked up speed to what would be expected of an airplane.  I ran into the house to get my video camera, but when I came out it was way far off.I am quite used to planes flying over and see them often.  I don&rsquo;t however EVER see a plane slow down, stop, and then completely change course.   It was very eerie watching that fly overhead with no noise at all!  The blinking red light seemed to indicate that it was manmade, but who knows?   Whatever it was it gave me the creeps!  I&rsquo;m a student here, and have good eyesight and wasn&rsquo;t at all drunk or anything.  This was not the first weird thing I&rsquo;ve seen here either.  On Dec, 23 and 24 of 2009, I saw a ball of light out in the distance that looked like the spot light on the front of a helicopter, but got dimmer and after it travelled some distance faded into nothing.  I saw this twice in two days!  I followed the second one for a block or so on foot just watching before it finally blinked out.  I highly doubt it was &quot;Chinese lanterns&quot; as some might say.  These were not flickering, and they were Venus bright at times and silent.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))}"

20100707,7/7/2010,20100708,7/8/2010, Dallas, TX,TX,USA,South, formation,10 seconds,10,10,very short,"3 crafts with amber lights suddenly appear , then disappearTime: between 8 and 9 PM, near dusk, partly cloudy with haze.While working at my computer in a bedroom with its window facing south (also faces the front yard of my house), I heard some strange noises outside the window.  The strange noises sounded as if there were hard droplets, hail, or a large amount of pecans falling onto my roof and sidewalk from trees outside.  Being concerned that a thunderstorm was blowing in, I stood up from the computer and went to the window to look through the blinds to see outside.When I peeked through the blinds, the strange sounds immediately stopped.  I looked into the yard and into the street across the way to see if rain drops or hail were falling.  Not seeing any drops of rain or hail, I then looked out onto the horizon to see if there were any thunderstorm clouds, and immediately saw a series of strange lights directly south approximately 15 degrees on the horizon.At first, the lights appeared to be three landing lights on the front of a large airplane heading north. What was strange about this apparent airplane was that it was banked downward as if it were about to turn to the west, but it did not move from this position.  The lights were all of the same amber color, with the two outermost lights the brightest, the center light more dim.  The craft stayed stationary as if it were parked in the sky at an angle.  The other odd thing about this craft was that it seemed to be extremely large, and located approximately 5 or 6 miles southward near the junction of the Dallas North Tollway and I-35.  An estimate of the size was approximately 300 or 400 feet across (huge).Then, incredibly, another craft of similar proportions (but further in the distance), suddenly appeared to the left of the first craft, and it was banked at a different angle compared to the first craft.  The sudden appearance of the second craft was immediate, as if a light switch or strobe had been turned on.  My immediate thought was that there was some sort of fireworks or laser light show being given near the American Airlines Center near downtown.  Then, incredibly, a third craft, immediately appeared to the right, with the same proportions, but at a different distance than the other two craft.  The third craft was also banked at a different angle compared to the others.  It was difficult to discern whether the crafts were actually moving very slowly, or if they were completely stationary.Then, each craft blinked its lights off and on (the three lights of a craft in unison) as if the crafts were communicating with each other.  The blinking seemed to be in a sequence, as if each craft was a separate ornament on a Christmas tree.  The sequential blinking lasted less than 1 or 2 seconds.  All of the lights disappeared as suddenly as they had appeared, but not at the same time (each craft &quot;turned-off&quot; at different times).All of the above took place on the order of about 10 seconds.  I have never seen anything like it before. I have been searching the news sites to see if anyone else saw the same lights.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))}"

A few weeks ago a similar incident was reported to the Jewell County Sheriff&rsquo;s office.According to Sheriff Dave Fullerton, the cause of the recent bull&rsquo;s death has not been determined.  The animal was found and reported to the sheriff&rsquo;s office last Tuesday by Jim Harris.  The bull was owned by Mike Harris but running in Jim Harris&rsquo; pasture.  It was found in a remote low area of a pasture located on 140 Road about one-third mile north of V Road.The bull was last seen by Jim Harris the prior Thursday afternoon so the time of death has been placed between that afternoon and its discovery the following Tuesday.According to Fullerton, the bull had one ear and other body parts cut off.  Since the bull was  lying on its right side, the sheriff could not see if the other ear of the right eye had been cut.  He observed, &quot;There was blood around the eye, on the left side and indications that it was partly cut, in an attempt to remove it as had been done in the other bull mutilation.&quot;  Fullerton said the person or person&rsquo;s responsible, did not finish cutting out the tongue, eye or eyes, as had been done in the other mutilation.  He noted, &quot;Something may have interrupted whoever is responsible and caused them to leave the scene before they completed the act.&quot;Fullerton checked for tracks in the snow but could only find cow tracks.The bull thought to be mutilated a month ago was found in a pasture north of Burr Oak.  That animal belonged to William Wilson, Burr Oak.

Me and my sis hollered at my brother to come see the UFO. We opened the sliding glass door to the right to go out to listen.  There was no sound.  The object was right above our trees in the front yard.  We expect the object was very close to the size of a football field. It slowly moved away revealing it was a disc shaped UFO with a line of lights around the whole ship. I would guess it was moving about 1-5 mph.  Our parents were sleeping at the time by the time we woke them it was so far away it could have been a airplane to them.  But for me and my siblings it was the closest encounter we have ever had.  I will always look to the sky...hoping this time i have a camera.  Note: This happened sometime in the summer of 96.

It flew directly to the left of me and it looked like a large jumbo jet but without wings.  It was silent, and I saw no lights on this object.  I felt it was a plane that was about to crash because it was so low to the ground and now just 50-100 feet above the road and to my left.  It passed me and I looked in the mirror expecting to see a large explosion/smoke or some evidence of a crash but there was nothing.  I could no longer see anything as the sky was dark.  Again I did not lose any power to my car or radio.I picked up a co-worker in Punta Gorda and continued to travel south to Estero, Fl., that morning, and saw nothing more but did mention my sighting to my co worker, and she just laughed.We returned home the following night (Sunday) around midnight, and about 10 miles south of Punta Gorda, we both witnessed another bright &quot;orb&quot; like object high in the sky.  We watched this for about a minute and it didn&rsquo;t seem to move, then suddenly it was gone.  We did not see it move, it was just there one moment and gone the next.  Shortly afterwards as we were exiting the highway to return to her house, she looked at her watch and commented that it was much later than it should be  when we arrived back.  It seemed to take us approx 45 minutes longer to make the trip from Estero to Punta Gorda that night.I had kept these 2 &quot;sightings&quot; to myself all this time until I mentioned something to my sister in law recently, and it was she who said that round &quot;orbs&quot; have been reported in the past as UFO&rsquo;s.I then found your web sight for reporting any sightings, and felt that perhaps this may be significant, even though it has been quite sometime ago.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the dates of the two sightings are approximate.

I remember thinking that it was funny that a car would pull out from this wooded area since there is no road or driveway.  It was very dark out but from driving this road every day.  I was aware that there were no roads on that side of the road.Suddenly, the orb which I had assumed was a vehicle light disappeared from behind me, but then noted in my passenger side mirror that this &quot;orb&quot; ( the color was slightly more yellowish than a clear headlight) was following directly to the right of my vehicle.  This &quot;orb&quot; followed me along the road for approximately 5 miles &quot;bouncing&quot; along the right  side of my car.  I also remember  thinking that it looked like the &quot;bouncing ball&quot; on the old  Mitch Miller show.  I then remember thinking maybe this was a UFO, but from anything I had ever seen on TV, this was not a UFO vehicle, and my radio was playing and the car was running so I  just couldn&rsquo;t figure out what this was.((END REPORT))}"

Looking closer we also noticed an other smaller object, white in color in front of the orange object.  The smaller object was visually typical of a satellite with a mag. of +4 or more, barely visible.

As is my habit, when I got out of the car I looked up and surveyed the nighttime sky. Looking in a south-easterly direction I noticed what looked to be an airplane. Again, as is my habit, I looked for the FAA lights (blinking red and green lights). I did not see any.  The light was pretty bright, so it&apos;s possible that, due to the angle and the brightness of the light, I just couldn&apos;t see them. I also noticed the speed, which seemed relatively normal for an airplane.  The trajectory was mostly straight, though for a moment I could have sworn that I saw it drift to the east just a bit. This could have been an optical illusion.  However, over the course of the 20 or so seconds that I was watching, I saw the light increase in brilliance.  The object seemed to get bigger, though this might have been an effect of the increasing luminosity, changing from an off-w! hite color to more of a resplendent white. This lasted about 5 seconds, after which the light dimmed, making the object seem as if it were getting smaller. As it dimmed it became blue, like so many stars.  What was left, for a moment, was a dim dot of light surrounded by an even fainter corona; it resembled the dot of light that would be left in the center of the screen on old black-and-white televisions immediately after being turned off.  This lasted for just a moment, after which the dot became smaller and dimmer, until disappearing altogether. I kept looking at the sky for at least another ten minutes, in case it was an airplane that had turned it&apos;s lights off momentarily, but the light did not reappear.  I could not see the outline of any kind of craft, nor was there a sound to be heard.}"

The objects were in no particular formation, they were randomly staggered to describe it best.  From my view they approached from the north making their way into my view from my building which blocked that part of the sky.  They were approaching my next visual obstacle, a tree, when one light seemed to disappear in the distance as if it went straight into the sky or due west away from me.

It was approximately 0245 -0300 hours in the am.  It was at the start of Belleville travelling from Toronto.  On the side of the road, 40 feet off their was a fiew lightpost near the edge to a field.  Some trailers were also parked near these lamps and I just plainly seen it hovering about 2.5 stories above the lamp post.  This thing was huge, i mean huge, and I trully, trully feel priviledged to see this with my own eyes and at such a close distance at that.  I&apos;m sure about 4-5 other cars on the road must have seen it as this this was BIG!  It was just hovering above and not doing anything, no noise or wind from the craft.  Theirs a reason why psyphy depicts them as circular saucers and this one was no exeption. It looked exactly in the movies. It had 4 circular lights under it but they were not in the middle of the craft.  They were kinda grouped and at the side of the underside of the craft facing away.  They were quite weird lights as they were clearly visible but emited absolutely no kind of lights nor beams of lights.  Just hovering in the night on the side of the road from highway 401 east.  I have never been so scared in my life.  My eyes were actually tearing as i almost crashed off the road in utter amasement.  I dont know why i was crying, its almost as if my body forced it, a natural process?  It was uncontrolable.  It was a dark color of some short, maybe black/grey.  This was kinda hard to judge as it was late and hard to see, let alone driving down the highway and seeing this thing.  So i have absolutely nothing to gain by this but hopefully this gets to the government as i am sure they keep track and what not.  If &quot;something&quot; were to ever happen years down the road, i hope we as human society will be ready because this thing was damn big and too be hovering with no noise nor wind- thats technology.i may be contacted by email at ((e-mail deleted)) if anyone is interested in further information although that! s basically it.}"

The formation was more of an long elongated formation.  Some crafts were in a tight formation while other crafts were spread out.  From what I can see, they were too high to be birds and too big to be balloons.  If they were white balloons, they should of been moving south because the wind was blowing from the north this evening at around 10 knots.  This was not a one time occurance in my area.  I usually see one or two during my weekend afternoons when I am usually working on my garden, but never thought of reporting it due to the fact that I don&apos;t know what it is.  But this time it was different, I saw 27-30 of this unusual craft moving overhead and the frequency of siting is increasing.I am at a close proximity to Oakland and San Francisco airport and see many planes of deferent make and sizes flying overhead.  I know what planes or helicopters looks like even at high altitude from the shape of the fuselage and wings.

It wasn&apos;t long, maybe just a few seconds before we both realized this very bright star seemed to be moving.  When we say bright, we mean like venus has been for the last several weeks, just really standing out in the night&apos;s sky.  So the &quot;craft&quot; (obviously can&apos;t call it a star now that it&apos;s moving), began to move upward in relation to it&apos;s neighboring stars then began to get brighter very quickly which we realized was being caused by it moving rapidly in our direction.As it approached I guessed it looked to be no more than 1 mile up, either that or it was a very large craft because as it flew over us we could distinguish individual lights on the body of the craft.  Also I could faintly see that there was a blinking of some sort, however my girlfriend got a much better view as she had run inside and got the binoculars.  She then raced to the north side of the house as it flew overhead and told me a moment later that she was able to clearly see what appeared to be a paramecium shaped craft with rythmically pulsing light from front to back.The craft continued it&apos;s North by Northeasterly course until I could no longer see it. It was extremely bright to me the whole 3 minutes that I was watching it. I have been fascinated by technology and space my whole life and am very familiar with our current abilities as humans in regards to vehicles and propulsion systems.  This craft or vehicle that my girlfriend and I both saw last night in no way compares to anything I have ever seen or heard of that humans can construct. It doesn&apos;t even compare to stretching our most advanced flying vehicles to the point of absurdity.  The reason I say that is the most shocking part of the experience for us:  The Speed of this craft, based on its apparent size, distance and luminosity had to be upwards of 5 or 6 Hundred MPH.  For all of its speed and distance covered, the craft we saw remained COMPLETELY silent.  I mean this thing didn&apos;t make a sound. Not in the distance and not when it was right above us, and it looked like it was over Sacramento 1 minute, then right above us in Nevada City the next, then on it&apos;s way over Nevada the next minute.I am completely certain this craft was not Man Made and I am not a ufo advocate, nor have I ever seen or reported anything like this in my life.}"

Moving at speed of an airplane but no sound, no &ldquo;structure&rdquo; seen, no blinking/flashing lights and if I recall correctly it was just below the overcast/clouds it may have been &ldquo;reflecting a bit&rdquo; off of them.   It was definitely low in the sky at height of planes I often see going into O&rsquo;Hare.Time Lapse  Aprox 10-15 Secs.    Aprx. Time: 11pm well after fireworks.I was standing looking around in the sky at the stars, planes etc.  I had a set of binoculars around my neck (which I occasionally do now when observing the night sky).  This object caught my attention as I happened to be looking SW.  I kept looking with my bare eyes as it traveled closer towards me (initially dismissing it as probable helicopter or plane).When I still couldn&rsquo;t make it out, I took two steps forward , looked down to grab the binoculars and sit (so I could steady my hands) to get closer view&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;but, in the few seconds it took to look down, grab binocs and glance back up&hellip;while trying to feel for the chair&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;it disappeared.  No where to be found as I continued to pan the sky and recapture it.Now, I was with one other person who did NOT see the object because it disappeared before I made any comment about it.   Even though I was VERY curious about the object, I  kind of &ldquo;blew it off&rdquo;  thinking, no way this happens two years in a row, it must have been legit craft and went into the clouds when I diverted my gaze.2 Years in a row?  That&rsquo;s a weird part of this occurrence.  The same thing happened last year (and I reported it on this site then -you can view it there) July 4th 2009.  At about same time/diff trajectory.  But,  in 2009 the color and appearance was more like a Hazy Orange glowing basketball/orb- more definitively round with an entirely fuzzy glow emitting from the object itself.  Now-In 2010 the object was definitely Red and I don&rsquo;t think I would describe it as purely &ldquo;round&rdquo; NOR as having a &ldquo;hazy&rdquo; glow&hellip;&hellip;any ambient glow was more of a steady &ldquo;reflection off clouds&rdquo; this time.Sorry my facts aren&rsquo;t exact.  As mentioned, I wasn&rsquo;t going to post this as I find it rather odd that, (1) It happened on Independence Day when millions would likely be looking to the skies.  And (2) Similar events happen two years in a row?  This does not change what I saw &ndash; either year --without a doubt.  But, It makes me suspicious that somebody might be pulling off a big hoax/scam/trick somehow&hellip;.or, some manmade flying thing makes the same trip every year on the 4th?  There were many sightings last year too.I decided to post my observation after I went into your site to see, by chance, if anyone else saw what I saw and was surprised to see one other Streamwood, IL. report. Plus many others elsewhere.  I hope you can investigate this somehow to see if there is an &ldquo;earthly&rdquo; answer.  Next year on 4th maybe you can send out trained spotters in Midwest with good equipment?

The first, which I have disqualified is that I was witnessing a reentry by the Space Shuttle at a much greater distance than I originally perceived and at an angle more or less directly toward my position.The second, is that I was watching some sort of burning balloon.  I had this notion in my mind tonight and then saw some you tube videos on Chinese lanterns.  If that is what I saw, it was quite large and was either on fire entirely, or was supporting an enormous flame before burning out.  This does however explain the orange flame color, the lack of sound, the slow movement, and the ultimate disappearance if it were to burn itself out.Still, I wish someone would confirm they saw what I saw last night, or someone would confess to launching the thing.

Fearing someone had hit my car I looked outside to see nothing out of the ordinary, but due to the load nature of this boom I continued to scan my neighborhood.  I then looked up to see that there was a orange ball of light in the sky.  This ball looked to be like fire, but seemed to be in a half circle shape, rounded in the front and trailing off to the back side.  I immediately called my wife to come to the window and take a look, and she came to the window and watch the events with me.The orange light in the sky continued from south to north disappearing behind a few clouds before reemerging from the clouds.  After this light had reached almost the end of our vision another orange light very much same shape as the first appeared to the south tracking about the same direction.Then we heard a boom to the north of our house.  The boom was accompanied by a bright flash that seemed to emanate from ground level, and that was very bright.  This was no fireworks, it was bright white, produced shadowing effects and kind of hurt our eyes.  Then this happened again, I moved to a window I could see farther north from but did not see anything burning nor any explanation for the booms or flashes.My wife then announced to me that another one had appeared to the south same as the first two.  Prior to this one even getting close to our house we heard two more loud booms each accompanied by that same bright flash.  At one point I feared we were under some kind of attack mainly due to the intensity of the booms, and flashes, I dialed 911, as I awaited the dispatcher (placed on hold and transferred once since I called from my cell phone, made this call at 10:30 per my cell phone memory)  I saw another one enter from the south this one on a path south to north but much closer to my house.We heard a total of eight to nine loud booms, and saw a total of four bright orange lights. and witnessed 6 flashes, we were not at the window for all of the booms, got phone for one and was moving to different window for another, and the original boom that made me go to the window was approx 3 booms I had not been looking outside during.The 911 dispatcher told me they had reports of fireworks in the area, but I told him it was not a fireworks display. The light was high enough to be in clouds, and was traveling south to north at a fairly slow pace for something that high in the sky, with the flash and explosions occurring farther north then the orange light in the sky, and the flash appearing to be ground level.During the event my wife and I saw our neighbors come outside pointing into the sky at the lights, with still other neighbors looking out their windows for the origin of the booms. I do intend to talk with them tomorrow, but wanted to file this tonight as the information was fresh on my mind.Although I do not personally believe in Aliens or any such thing, I know today I was witness to something unidentified and flying.  I am not prone to events like this, having worked 10 years as a paramedic and been very scientifically grounded I realize now, that this was something very odd and I am intent to find out what was going on.}"

When we saw a bright light moving slowly across the sky from NW to SE.  The bright light did not have any blinking navigation lights so I knew it was not an airplane. There were airplanes in the area though and they all had blinking nav. Lights on.  This bright light was going about the same speed as a satellite maybe a little bit faster but much slower than a meteor.   It flew across the entire sky and then was gone.  The light just vanished. This was a very intense light like something from spot light from far away.  I wonder if it was the international space station.  I don&rsquo;t know.

The street we were on ran north and south. A red fireball appeared in the northern skies, directly north of us, and we initially thought that it was a flare someone had shot off.  The red fireball continued to fly overhead and to the south-south-east.  It was definitely flying lower than a commercial airliner but higher that a local police or news helicopter would be flying. Its altitude was more like what the local military jets fly.  Its flight speed was also similar to what U.S. jet would be.  Also, it did not emit any noticeable jet, propeller, or helicopter rotor sounds.  Once it was almost out of site, it appeared to increase altitude and head back northerly along the same path.  We then notice two additional red fireballs coming from the same northern location and travel along the same path as the first.  I ran into the hou! se to get my binoculars and viewed the crafts as small single balls of reddish light; no other shape of the craft was apparent in the dark night sky.  One member of our party took two digital still pictures of one of the crafts with little to no enhancement by the limited zoom.  Before the end or the half hour encounter, four more craft individually traveled overhead from the north to the south.  All craft had the same attributes.  We did not stay out any longer than that due to our lack of fireworks and the night was very cold and windy.}"

I would also estimate it to have been approximately 8 to 10 times the size of those planes.  It moved very quickly and made no discernable sound and left no trail.The object appeared to be mostly white in color, possibly glowing or having a shiny reflective surface.  It appeared to be cylindrical or &quot;cigar shaped&quot; with a dark line or area at its center, with brighter areas at each end.  No flashing or blinking lights were observed, though there appeared to be a mild haze around it.Both my son and I observed the object until it disappeared from view.

It has a nice open space where the stars are visible with a picnic area that you can sit at.  We went out wanting to enjoy the nice weather and have a romantic ending to our night.  It was around midnight when we went, walked to the back of the pond and sat down.  We where there for aproximately 10 minutes when I looked up saw something circular blinking in the sky.The object was towards the south of us flying lower than an airplane would, and it was blinking red, green, orange, blue and yellow, something an airplane would not do.  I urged my husband to look at it, and he agreed that it was not a plane.  The object was not moving at all, as if it where hovering.  We both at the time just kind of blew it off a bit,joked about it being a UFO we lit a cigarette, and looked up and it was gone.  This is when we began to freak out and get real serious about it, realizing that we where talking about it and observing it for at least 10 minutes without it moving, and then it just disappeared.We continued to scan the sky when I noticed the same looking object to the west of us.  Appearing about 5 minutes after the other one dissapeared.  It had the same blinking colors, only the distance seemed closer, and lower than before.  We kept watching it hover in place, shift to the left and right real fast, and then at moments it would stop flashing colors and turn a yellow-orange color.  It also would get distant and then come closer.  My husband then noticed to the north another one, by this time I am really freaking out, and almost in tears because I cant believe my eyes.  My husband on the other hand excited about what he is seeing.  My husband watched the one towards the north as I watched the one to the west.  We would report back and forth to eachother what they where doing as we watched.  My UFO then shifts right then zooms left leaving a trail of light behind it then dissapears in a split second.  If i would have blinked I would have missed it! Im still not sure where it d! issapeared to.Since the UFO I was staring at had disappeared we both continued to watch my husbands, which was not moving at all.  It was just flashing red, orange, green, blue, and yellow.  I looked over in the direction where the one I was observing disappeared, and it reappeared!  They where both there in the sky again, one to the north, and one to the west.  The one that I was watching seemed as if it would get distant, and then come closer, contunuing to shift right to left and up to down.  My husbands seemed to stay in the same spot not getting closer or farther.  As we observed them seperately we would continue to report back and forth to eachother what they where doing.This all came to an end at about 2:40 p.m. when all the sudden mine turned yellow-orange, then his did too.  Then mine started blinking colors, then his did too.  Then all the sudden both of them began to get distant and higher extremely fast together(still in their seperate directions of west and north), then they both just disappeared.   We stayed until 3:00 to see if they would come back, but they didnt, so we walked to our apartment.From what we collected and witnessed, it seemed as if the two crafts where comunicating back and forth with their lights because one would blink lots of colors then turn to a yellow-orange color, then the other would do the same.   And it also seemed as if the one I was watching was on a mission, as the other one was on the lookout.   We collected this because mine was doing all the moving and his was just still.I had a very hard time getting to sleep after having experienced this.  My husband was very excited about our experience, and was releived that he now knows life on other planets exist.  He seemed pretty calm about it, but still said that he was a little freaked out.  I have never been a believer in aliens and UFOs, but I now honestly have to say, that after experiencing this, I am a believer.  Nothing could explain or justify what we saw.((NUFORC Note:  Possible twinkling star, or celestial body, perhaps?  PD))}"

I studied harder and harder, as did my boyfriend and human aircraft was not coming up as a logical option.  It was traveling very fast but you could tell it was so high that it wasn&apos;t going from point A to B in a snap, as others describe sightings often.  It was the type of thing that when you looked away for a few seconds, and tried again to sight it, it would be much further east.  (Kentucky facing Indiana).  Eventually it got to be at such an elevation, it was hard to keep up with and make out anymore. Moments later, I noticed even further southeast, it seemed to have two other identical objects waiting for it.  As my boyfriend and I were making our way to the port-o-john&apos;s, also in their direction, we looked up and all three were gone.  He said others around us were pointing and had also noticed.

It&apos;s a relief to tell someone!Hello, I know you have a lot of pranks and false reports that are turned into you all the time.  I worked for the Utah power and light company out of Salt Lake Utah around 1981-82 time frame and I was on a small crew near Jensen, Utah, erecting power line towers.  We had just finished one of the towers at around 6:00 pm and began loading all of the equipment into the trucks getting ready to end the shift and go back to the warehouse.One of the guys spoke up and said look at that!  The object looked like a silver cigar holder and I would say it was approx. 40-60 ft. long, and approx. 10-15 ft. wide, and rounded at both ends, with a gold light on the front and a blue light in the middle.  I also estimate that the object was about a mile away from us at the time we first saw it.  As best as I can remember it had no signs of trailing gas and was silent.  We saw it coming from the northern horizon and it only took probably 10 seconds to go out of sight in the southwestern horizon.  I know that it was not a satellite, jet, or anything I have ever seen before, it was in our inner atmosphere, in other words it was very close to us.  My opinion the SR-71 Blackbird or the X-15 wouldn&rsquo;t have had a chance.  I have been seeing a lot of reports on the net and on TV about sightings lately and am very reluctant to let anyone know about this.This event happened years ago and it is as though it happened a few minutes ago.  It has been bothering me for a long time and I am just now getting the courage to tell someone, it is a relief!  I mentioned this to my wife once and she said, are you sure you weren&rsquo;t smoking pot, drinking or something?  I replied to her that all that I was doing was drinking a jug of iced tea I had in my lunch.   She didn&rsquo;t take me serious at the time but she has since then changed her mind.  I work for a government defense contractor now and am aware of the many false reports that people make and some that are very real.  I know what I saw was real and in my knowledge of air travel and planes, jets, drones and similar aircraft, we have nothing! like what I saw.  This was in the 1981-82 time frame.  I hope if the government does have craft such as this that they let everyone know about it soon to stop all the speculation.

Whats interesting about that is Ive learned through months of everyday observing that planes do not fly in from the North, so I picked up my binoculars (used for watching the planes and helicopters fly from Nellis) and saw that it was one of those &quot;Janet&quot; planes that transport employees to and from Area 51 (Classic red stripe passenger plane with no identifiable markings). As I followed the plane with my binoculars, I then noticed something appear in my field of vision that was further away beyond the! Janet plane. I stopped and adjusted my binocs to get a clearer image of what this object was, and once I did I could see a white, solid, dome shaped object hovering in place far off in the distance. I know distances can be deceiving, so I dont want to say how far away i think it was exactly, but I can say it was miles, beyond Sunrise mountain and perhaps even Lake Mead. I stood and watched it for 2-3 minutes until I noticed another Janet plan coming into approach at McCarran. I took my eyes off the craft for only a second and when I scanned the area it had been, it was gone! I searched the entire sky for about 20 minutes and never saw it again. It was dome shaped, white and never moved from the spot I first saw it. I assume that it was far away, and if it was then I would say the craft was huge. Being stationary, I was able to study it for 2-3 minutes through my binoculars and though it was too far to make out any details, I can say it was big enough to clearly make out it! s shape. I am absolutely certain that it was not a plane, heli! copter, weather balloon, or any other craft Ive ever seen in my life. It was a clear, hot summer day with no clouds in sight. I hope you find this information useful.((NUFORC Note:  We have corrected the date above.  PD))}"

It covered the whole sky in maybe 4 seconds.  No tail or burn like a meteor but just a bright white orb.  It appeared to be very high.

The beam was too wide (6 inches perhaps) to be a joker with a lazer, and anyway it could be seen in front of the houses at a point on the ground.  There was no sound of a helicopter or any other craft.  We have often seen police helicopters over the district with their white searchlights, quite different from this event.  Also, their engines make a loud noise overhead.  I was with my gran, who is very sceptical about such things, but she was frightened by this, and wanted to get away.  She described the clouds as having a strange two-dimensional appearance, with the one emitting the beam being dome-shaped.The beam went off suddenly and nothing occurred since.

Initially though it was a nearby mylar balloon ascending in the evening wind.  Upon observing, I realized it was considerably more distant because a light aircraft landing nearby at a community field eclipsed the object and based on the size I would have estimated it to be much closer if it was a &quot;free-ranging&quot; balloon.  Still skeptical, I observed and noticed the sphere ascending slowly to the south at a steady rate.  A faint fuzziness existed around its perimeter. I photographed the sky using a blackberry camera phone such that each frame should encompass the sphere.  To my amazement the object passed behind a thin but opaque cloud during the observation period.  This then confirmed that it was much higher and further away than a mylar balloon or facsimile.  The object maintained its altitude (estimated ~2000-3000 ft).  The presence of numerous jets landing and small private aircraft preclude the notion of a misidentification of a plane as a black/opaque sphere.  Six images were taken as it progressed southward to ultimately disappear.  I am posting this observation in response to seeing NUFORC reports of similar  in the vicinity.}"

But I thought it was very strange becaue it was so tiny compared to any other cloud I had seen.  The object was far in the distance.  I would estimate at roughly 5 or 6 miles away.  Regardless of me thinking it was strange, I still just thought it was a cloud especially considering it was greyish in color.  It stood absolutely still in the sky.  I had the moon that was about a fist&apos;s length away as a good landmark for reference.  I quickly went into my house for maybe 20 seconds to grab my binoculars which were right by the door.  I turn around and look out and the object is gone.  This is what made me decide it was not a cloud.  This fact combined with that it was not moving.  I figured a cloud doesnt just disappear in less than 20 seconds and it definitely wouldnt have moved out of sight in that time considering it didnt appear to be moving in the first place.

It was positioned due east of the condo and was just coming into our field of vision to the right of the condo building on our left.  I rushed to the video camera and by the time I was able to get it on and open it disappeared.  That video is also available.

Myself and &quot;L&quot; were observing fireworks when it was noticed moving at a high speed from 9 o&apos;clock to 12 o&apos;clock.

I began filming as soon as I returned to the balcony and attached is that film unmodified.  The orb was due east over the water and far higher than the fireworks that were being launched from the beach.

The object was oval in shape with a circular center of brightness in the distal 1/3rd of the oval.  The color that it was emitting was orange in the proximal 2/3rd and bright yellow orange in the distal 1/3rd.  The distal 1/3rd of the object was pulsating with light and at times appeared brighter yellow to white, and pulsed back and forth to yellow orange.  In order to get a close reference my friend &quot;S&quot; stood in front of me while filming approximately 1 and a half feet from the end of the camcorder.  At this point the object is viewed directly over her head and behind her toward the east over the ocean. We observed this oval orb for about 1 minute with our first sighting and for approximately 3 minutes during our second sighting.  There was only one orb spotted during each sighting.

I&rsquo;d say they were at 15 degrees as far as elevation goes.  Since there were 4 of them and the color was different than the aircraft I see flying into PDX I decided to look at them a little closer. I held still, trying to discern any movement amongst any of the lights using the roof lines of my neighbor&rsquo;s home as a reference.  I detected no movement and it crossed my mind that they could be stars.  Then I thought about it and looked for other stars in the sky and they were nowhere near the brightness or the color.  As far as brightness goes I would say maybe 10 times as bright as a normal star, and maybe half as bright as the lights I see on the commercial aircraft flying in and out of PDX.  Also they were smaller than the lights of the commercial aircraft appear.  So, I go to my car, which was closer to my neighbor&rsquo;s and just make a note of it in my head in case I hear an explanation on the news.Coming out of my car, I heard/saw my neighbor&rsquo;s garage door opening.  I was excited so I went to go tell him what I had seen.  But before I could I thought I&rsquo;d better go back to were I could see them just to verify they were still there; they were gone.  I decided to tell him anyway because he saw me and asked &lsquo;why are you running&rsquo;?  I then explained what I had just seen. About 30 seconds later tow teen girls came walking down the sidewalk (east bound).  I asked them had they seen the lights and they said yes.  I asked them if they were freaked out and they said yes.  I told them my story and that I didn&rsquo;t see what happened to them.  They said the 4 lights moved together into one.

Completely equal distant from each other and exactly identical in brightness and size appeared in the sky. We both couldn&apos;t believe what we were seeing and then the two lights at what appeared to be the top of the formation disappeared, quickly followed by the last light.We sat and questioned what we had seen and tried to logically come up with some type of explanation and the only thing we could come up with was that it was an unidentified flying object or objects.

I began to watch it as it traveled across the sky very slowly.  It was low for a jet or commercial plane, but still much higher than any blimp you would normally see.  I began to think maybe it was a weather balloon of some type, but eventually decided that since it was traveling on such a direct path that it must be some sort of vehicle with an engine.  I was first surprised by the fact of a blimp so high in the air at first, but what really surprised me was what happened after it had traveled halfway across the sky.  It was traveling at the same speed, never stopped or slowed or sped up, yet when it had traveled roughly halfway across the horizon it spat out a huge chunk of white &quot;smoke&quot;.  Then about 3-5 seconds later it spit out another hunk of what I thought was smoke.  Now there were 2 dashes ! of smoke across the sky coming from what I thought was a blimp.  My second witness also witnessed these puffs of smoke.  However, seconds after these two puffs were spat out, it began to emit a CONSTANT trail of this smoke like substance, just like your typical Chemtrail (or Contrail, I suppose).  After traveling at the same speed completely across the horizon, this Blimp (which looked like a cigar covered in Aluminum foil) just SUDDENLY, out of nowhere without changing a thing in trajectory, speed, or altitude, began to omit a chemtrail. It literally looked like a giant crop-dusting blimp, miles in the air.  The thought of it made us feel extremely eerie and upset for the remainder of the day.}"

It was faintly dark gray and was spinning so it looked like a rectangle building block being thrown and spinning. It spun and flew slowly for about 9, 10 seconds.  I was watching this from my balcony so I had a very clear view.  It was spinning to look as if someone had thrown a very big, very far rectangle and it was actually going very fast and I would be able to tell if I was way closer.Then all of the sudden, it stopped spinning, it was still flying for 3 seconds, then stopped flying also. Since it was sitting there just still and obvious for a couple seconds I wanted to grab my low power telescope as soon as possible. So I got my telescope and came back out.  It was still in this position. So I looked at it through my telescope, and all I saw was the same big gray rectangle but, this magnified, I could see that one corner of it (the top right corner) had a bent, broken off part. I zoomed in and out and if I zoomed out slightly, I couldn&apos;t see the broken off part. It just looked like the rectangle I saw without the telescope.  But through the telescope, as zoomed in as I could possibly get, I could see the faintest yellowish glow around the edges of the rectangle.  There were no sounds or rumbles whatsoever coming from said rectangle(s). Nor any lights.  Just dark gray.I know it had to be something far, far off in the night sky and not some kind of bag or weird toy (they&apos;re making all kinds of weird, powerful kids&apos; toys these days) because even through my telescope it was still far and fuzzy.  And I&apos;ve easily looked at Jupiter through my telescope before.After putting my telescope back down on a chair, I looked back up in the sky and it was gone... poof... just... gone. Very frustrated, I stayed on the balcony looking at the sky. The same thing came again, appearing over some nearby buildings.  But this one (or the same one?) was not spinning, just flying through the sky very slowly. I looked at this one through my telescope and saw nothing.  Not one thing!  So I looked up and it was gone, again.  Weird?  A little creepy.[Conditions at this time were 84*F outside and no clouds in view during this sighting]}"

It then just zoomed off at tree top level with a whooshing sound at a very fast, steady speed and disappeared quickly.  We didn&apos;t say a word to the other people watching (which seems odd in retrospect) and got in our car and attempted to follow it.

That night, my girlfriend and I were sitting on their deck enjoying a romantic evening when 5-6 lights appeared maybe 35 degrees above the horizon.  At first I dismissed it thinking that it was just a group of air planes from the nearby military base, but as we watch the lights go higher in the sky they began to divide into smaller points of light and dramatically change direction.  By now we were curious, knowing that neither of us had seen anything move so quickly and precisely in the sky before.  The lights came closer and closer and were just below cloud level when all of the darting points reconvened and assumed a linear shape.  The lights were at an angle that made it impossible to tell for sure, but it looked almost like a bent line (chevron?) as it veered north.What made it so peculiar and distinctively not an airplane was the in consistency of its movement and the way the lights divided themselves.

I know this was around the time I earned my driver&rsquo;s license, but the date may be off by a year or so.  Sorry for the inconvenience.At the time, I was living in Winslow AZ, and two friends and I were driving to Flagstaff in the late afternoon to catch a movie.  I was sitting in the back seat, passenger&rsquo;s side. We were traveling west on I-40, coming up on the Leupp exit. This is the first exit after Winslow, traveling west.  At this exit, there is a large butte.  I&rsquo;m not sure how tall the butte is, but here is a link to google maps where you can see the actual google photo of the butte.  There is a car and a couple of road signs in the picture to help with the scale of the photo.http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&amp;ll=35.065833,-110.825272&amp;spn=0,0.084543&amp;z=14&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=35.069161,-110.834558&amp;panoid=--tNYYmSTeVgXLV4q9Gpgw&amp;cbp=12,0,,0,5  As we approached this exit and butte, we were startled by the sight of what appeared to be a hovering commercial airplane to the right of the car.  Just an average airplane, only without any insignia or markings.  We could clearly see the windows, without people in them.  Not only was it hovering, but it was incredibly low.  Only two or three times the height of the butte off the ground, less than 1000 feet.  There was no sound.Like I said, this took place during the afternoon, and well within the sight of the highway. It was practically hovering over the exit ramp.  There were tons of people pulled over on the side of the road, going in both directions.  They were talking about it, some on their phones, others were taking pictures. We were too scared to stick around to see what would happen next, so we kept driving.  I remember turning around in my seat to watch it out of the back window.  It stayed in the same position until I lost sight of it.How many people must drive on that major interstate in the afternoon on any given day during a 15-30 minute period? My guess is about 500.   Everyone who drove by saw it, it was impossible not to. I&rsquo;m hoping one of those people will remember seeing this too, possible post a picture.

20100710,7/10/2010,20100711,7/11/2010, North Attleboro, MA,MA,USA,Northeast, fireball,about 5 minutes,5,300,short,"5 or 6 objects appeared low in the sky as fireballs/dome shaped objectsI had a sighting last night (Saturday, July 10, 2010) in North Attleboro, MA at approx. 10:10 PM E.S.T..  This was also witnessed by my wife and our two sons, and also my friend and his wife (and perhaps his two kids).  We first saw the objects while driving home in our cars from a fireworks event in town.  We were in two separate cars but close to each other.  We were about 1.5 miles away from where the fireworks were when we saw about 5-6 objects low in the sky.  We first saw the objects travelling down Landry Avenue, toward Kelly Boulevard (in North Attleboro), in the vicinity of the Joseph Martin Elementary school.  They appeared to be travelling north to south (or slightly northwest to southeast).  My wife first saw them, as I was driving the car.  I looked over and my initial thought was that whatever they were, it was definitely strange (particularly the brightness and the slow movement of them).  I thought it was a constellation for a split second, but then quickly realized they were too low and too bright to be a constellation.  Again, they were very low in the sky and much brighter than any night star or planet that I&rsquo;ve ever seen.(I should mention that we had a weather cold front move through earlier in the late afternoon that day with heavy rain, so there was still a heavy overcast, although the town fireworks went off as planned.  The cloud ceiling was high enough that the fireworks were visible; no issues there.  There was no rain at the time of this sighting).We proceeded to drive to my house, which was just around the corner.  My friend and his wife were heading to their house, which was some 30 minutes drive away (Northborough, MA).  As I got out of my car, 3 of the objects were almost directly overhead.  My guess is that they were several hundred feet up in the sky, to maybe a thousand feet.  They were all uniformly reddish/orangish and appeared to &quot;shimmer&quot; slightly.  They had the shape of a small dome, and they were fairly large (you didn&rsquo;t have to strain to see them).  They were definitely larger than anything in the sky and symmetrical as best I could tell.  My wife and my two boys witnessed the same thing.  I called my friend on his cell phone and asked if he saw them, and he said he had, and thought they looked really strange.  He was puzzled too.  2 of the 3 objects were very close to each other at one point, with the 3rd one straggling behind.  At one point, the 3rd one seemed to increase its velocity slightly, moving sideways, toward where the other two were.   What I thought was really unique is that they made absolutely no sound.  They kind of hovered, then moved slightly.  I watched them for only about a minute, and then they disappeared into the overcast above.I called the local police and they said they didn&rsquo;t receive any calls; same for the local newspaper, nothing.  North Attleboro is a town of about 30,000 or so, so we&rsquo;re not a rural area; others should also have seen this (particularly with fireworks having just ended and a lot of cars on the road).  Landry Avenue is a main route that took people away from the fireworks, which many people viewed at the High School, also on Landry Avenue.I also sent an email to several friends that are in my section of town to ask them if they saw anything; I haven&rsquo;t received responses back yet, as of this morning.}"

It would glide low along the fields about 200 yards to our right and than rise and fly over the highway.  It was a busy night and there was traffic on this highway out in the middle of nowhere.  As it flew overhead I could make out the shadow of it blocking out the stars as it was a clear night.  It repeated the same manuevers and the traffic began to clear up after about 20 minutes.

Three minutes later, I zoomed in and took another picture.  I also did a short video clip with a description of what we were looking at.My children did not see it at first but I brought it to their attention by directing them to look in an area in between and above two red turrets and then to follow up the sky to the last cloud.  They did locate it at that point.  I would have to say we were there for at least 10 minutes and it had remained in the same place.When I got home, I was convinced I got nothing but then when I pulled up the picture, I located the spot in the picture and with interest magnified it.

On the original picture with the cloud, you cannot see the spot too easily but once you locate it and magnify it, you can view the sphere.The best way to find it is to look at the cloud, move your eyes to the part on the bottom that resembles the map of Italy.  From there look to the right and once you reach the far right side of the cloud, you will see a tiny dot-don&rsquo;t ask me why I even noticed it on such a bright day.I have no idea what it was-a weather balloon?-but as shown by the pictures I took, it had not moved in the space of three minutes.

A huge burst of light came out of the side of it and then I realized it was rotating with the one light coming around every few seconds that&apos;s what it looked like, I could not see any shape to it but it looked like a small star floating across the sky until it started this rotating and shining of this huge light which I could see going outwards from the object like a flash light being turned on a foggy night.  I want to also make a comment, I believe something is happening and that there is going to be a major event soon.((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were at an intersection Hulmeville and Gibson when we saw a really bright light moving across the sky way in front of us.  We got a green light and started moving towards the direction the light was going; however, it now was coming in our direction.It seemed to have made a complete turnaround in a matter of 25 seconds or less.  It then changed direction again crossing over Hulmeville road.  At this point I still was not convinced until I got away from some of the high trees and saw it had stopped.  It was just sitting in the sky about maybe 800 feet up give or take.  At this point the brighter lights were no longer on just 3 dull lights (white) and one red light which were not blinking.  All the lights though were dull at this point even the red one.Then I rolled my window down and heard nothing.  I could hear cars, people, and one point even crickets but no sounds that something should make just hovering there in the sky.  It then slowly started to turn and the point or tip of the triangle was pointing downward as it rotated.  Then we had to keep moving and it slowly started crossing the houses over school nearby.  The sighting was about 5 minutes but we turned around about 5 extra minutes to get back to that area and we could not see it anywhere.We looked and looked and nothing.  I believe it was the same craft design wise that me and my ex saw in December 8th 2002 in Croydon.  I believe that this is probably our spacecraft that are reverse engineered off of Alien spacecraft.  This and the one in 2002 are mostly TR-3B or a variant of it.}"

The object rose straight up at least 500 feet from where I first saw it and was not affected by any winds aloft that would usually sway a balloon horizontally.

I have pictures of a few of these crafts but not the one that I&apos;m reporting.  I was standing out in my driveway looking up at the night sky. Looking, constantly looking for something unusual.  After about 2 hours of staring at the stars, I finally decided to go back inside my home.  After I walked up to my front door, I opened the storm door and then turned around once more to look into the sky. When I fist noticed it, I wanted to freak out.  There it was an object floating in on a direct path, It didn&apos;t move side to side or volley up and down. It moved as if though it had a mission or purpose. I was nervous, and scared,  So afraid in fact that I could feel my knees buckling. I guess because I didn&apos;t know what to expect and I wanted to act non aggressive. I though that I was either going to be taken, blasted into nothing, or become part of this things menu. So I! wanted whatever or whoever was propelling this thing to know that I am not a threat. As It approached from the North sky,  It floated down into my yard just above the tree in the center of my yard. Then it lowered itself approximately 7 to 10 feet above my head and stopped for approximately 5 to 7 seconds then proceeded forward ascending above my rooftop. As it was leaving I yelled out &quot;What are You.&quot; it never made a sound, not one sound. It was an unusual color.  A low intensity pinkist to violet light, that was almost hypnotic to look at. When I first noticed it all that could be seen was the front. As it came closer I noticed that it&apos;s body was approximately 20 to 30 feet in length. The body looked as if though it was filled with fluid color. It had no wings. the body also had no real width (I mean that it appeared that nothing living could occupy that space). approximately 1 foot in width, but the front was enormous compared to the body 4 to 5 feet in width. There were! windows or slits in the front that were slanted in opposite d! irection s and were also illuminated. As it elevated higher to clear my house and the trees in the back yard its speed never accelerated. I would guess that it&apos;s speed was approximately 10 to 15 miles per hour until it was out of sight. It should also be mentioned that I attempted to get video of all of this, but upon uploading my camera videos to my computer I noticed that I had nothing. I pushed record my battery was charged and had worked with all other encounters, but not this one. After I went inside I told everyone about this encounter.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))}"

20100807,8/7/2010,20100810,8/10/2010, Peebles, OH,OH,USA,Midwest, circle,<1 minute,1,60,very short,"round object with much smaller attached object circling the main object in vertical motionI am a casual amateur astronomer with some working knowledge of the night sky.  I had just begun an evening of stargazing in rural southern Ohio and was planning to start with sightings of Venus, Saturn, and Mars, which were grouped quite close together just after sunset on 8-7-10.  I noticed the object in question while waiting for Venus to appear after sunset.  In terms of brightness it looked a lot like Venus, but it was way too high in the sky to be that planet, and its brightness was probably closer to that of Jupiter, which was not due to appear until much later in the evening.  I thought perhaps it was a very bright star but did not know what star it might be.To attempt to identify the object, I trained my 6-inch Dobsonian with low magnification on the object.  What I saw was a disc, but not a disc in the sense of a flying saucer type object seen edge-on.  Rather, it was perfectly round and about the size of Jupiter on high magnification.  It appeared to have some markings on it somewhat similar to the light and dark areas seen on Mars when that planet is relatively close to Earth.  It did not appear to be moving at all.As I observed the object, I noticed it had a much smaller object which appeared to be circling it, much as you might see the Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter.  But the circling was not horizontal like a natural satellite --- east-west or west-east --- but rather a vertical polar orbit.  As I watched, the smaller object moved from about the 7:00 o&apos;clock position on the main object up to the very top 12:00 o&apos;clock position.  What was even weirder was that the smaller object appeared to be attached to the main object by a line which was very thin but quite visible.All of this happened very quickly, in a matter of a few seconds, and after this brief observation I was mystified as to what the object might be.  I thought perhaps it might be some exotic satellite of which I was unaware.  I took my eye from the telescope so I could just look at it to see if it was moving across the sky in a straight line at a steady rate with a steady brightness the way satellites do.  But when I looked up it had vanished.  Satellites wink out when they enter the earth&apos;s shadow and are no longer illuminated by the sun.  But as far as I could tell this object was not moving at all.  Had it been moving I would have almost certainly noticed some movement of the main object when I was looking at it through the telescope, since magnification also magnifies the perceived motion of an object across the sky. I have never seen anything like this and I am at a loss as to what this object might have been.  I was sober with my faculties intact when I observed it. {:&gt;) If anyone has seen something similar or knows what it may have been I would be interested in some feedback.}"

I was 23, male, American; others were early 20&apos;s Scottish and Canadian, both male.  Other witnesses had been smoking hash, I was completely sober.  We were on the roof of the hotel watching a meteor shower.  There was a (wedding?) party a few blocks away from us with big flood lights that were periodically blowing out all the lights in our section of the town, and there were few street lights.  While I/we were looking up, the object flew directly over us, and I watched it travel from almost directly over us where I first noticed it to the horizon. With no reference objects in the sky I can only guess at the size and speed.  If I held my hand above me at arm&apos;s length my thumbnail would have almost covered it. It took 5-6 seconds to travel about 60 degrees across my field of vision.  It seemed much lower than the stars, and I could clearly see the edges, so my guess is it was between the size of a single prop plane and an airliner, flying at about 10,000 feet (higher than a prop plane but much lower than an airliner).  The shape was perfectly geometric: draw a circle, cut it in half, then remove two half circles with the &quot;corners&quot; touching from the straight line where the original cut was made and that would be the exact shape.  The result if you were drawing it should be something like a rounded boomarang with a point comming out of the back.  It made no noise at all, and had no running lights.  It appeared to have a dull orange glow; the closest thing I can compare the color/glow to is the coil of an electric stove when the coil is just starting to heat up.  I cannot say if the glow was coming from the object or was a reflection from the lights from the party.  In any case, it was not very bright and since it made no noise, I do not think I would have seen it if I had not already been looking up.  I discussed the sighting with the other witness from Scotland and it was evident he saw what I did; the witness from Canada said he was &quot;not sure what he saw&quot; and would not discuss it.  It didn&apos;t really have a &quot;haze or aura around the object&quot; so I didn&apos;t check that box, the light was more like &quot;on&quot; the object and didn&apos;t extend from it.  If someone wants a verbal description or clarification, or can tell me what it was, I do not mind being contacted by phone or email.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I took three shots on super hi-res Raw, decided then i didnt want to wait for the data to load and miss somthing, i set it back to Hi-res Raw, where i can get six shots in a row instead of two. I then looked back at the star and it didnt move or change magnitude, I squashed the mosquitoes into a bloody mush that where sucking my legs and head and ripped six more shots before i dove back in the house. I didnt have my computer, forgetting it at moms, until today. I looked at the back of the camera enlarging it and saw a star, whatever! I then continued watching B.S.G. until it was over, about five minutes and went out for a smoke again because the mosquitoes ended my last one early and i was high on coffee. I looked back up in the sky, no star! it was gone!! not a star in the twilight sky anywhere yet. I ran back in grabbing my camera and started looking at all the photos of the disapearing star. When i got to the second photo my heart dropped it wasnt a star at all!!! As i looked at the V, UFO i couldnt figure out if it was  a trailer of a single solid object from a long exposure or the object moving during the exposure viewing it on the back of the camera.

I was able to go onto the patio of our residence and could not hear any sound coming from the object.  It was moving at a pace consistent with air traffic , but was outside of the normal areas where we have previously seen air traffic and had no flashing lights that one would expect to see on a traditional aircraft.  The object was at an altitude that I would estimate at between 2,000 to 3,000 feet and appeared to be travelling parallel to the ground, not increasing or decreasing in altitude.  The object appeared similar to a rocket, although all that I was able to make out was the flame.  The flame was distinctly red and lacked the white or yellow colorations that I have seen when observing several shuttle launches! .  The object was heading towards the Potomac Maryland area.  The object was flying in a straight path.I am a financial services executive and have never previously reporting anything of this nature.

I have taken into consideration that this could be it a meteor, but I have come to the conclusion that it was not a meteor.I was sitting on the couch in my living room watching for meteors the would inevitably come into view tonight.  When I was getting bored of watching, something finally caught my eye., I thought, &quot;A meteor!,&quot; but another thought popped into my head; this meteor wasn&rsquo;t moving.   After about 10 minutes of watching this orb of light it quickly moved down and to the left, on slightly but it moved nonetheless.  The orb left a small trial, like a jet, but it disappeared within 20 seconds or so. Then 5 minutes or so afterwards, it again shifted; up and to the left.  Again it left a tail and it&rsquo;s tail vanished.The orb was a white color with an ever so slight hint of blue.I attempted to photograph this phenomenon but it would not show up on my camera (Kodak EasyShare P712) it did though show in a few pictures but with much movement of my hands I couldn&rsquo;t get a clear shot.I am unsure of  what I saw, I know that that light was not there on an ordinary night, and I also had the thought that it could be a star, but stars don&rsquo;t move (well not that fast anyway)! I am leaving you with this information and hoping you can make sense out of it.P.S. I would like it if you would not call my home phone, an e-mail would be fine if you do decide to contact.}"

The objects were triangular in shape, vertical with the apex pointing straight up. Inside the triangles were undulating white, green and red lights that morphed around inside the triangles like colored bubbles inside a lava lamp.  Each triangle was about the size of a dime at arm&rsquo;s length.Initially the triangles passed from the south toward the north in a somewhat horizontal path and stopped due east about 45 degrees above the horizon.  At the same time I saw an airplane pass in front of the triangles and then I saw a satellite pass over them. They were bigger than the jet airliner so they must have been at least 100 feet on a side. The objects were distinctly different from either the airliner or the satellite. The objects were about as high as the plane and beyond it a ways. Once the triangles stopped, they slowly moved around in the sky, up, down and sideways with no particular pattern to their movements.  At times they hovered nearly still in their positions and then they would resume their dance.  The objects were never touching and did not remain adjacent to one another.  Eventually they started moving directly upward.  The triangle on the right stayed in position lower than the one on the left.As I watched the objects ascend, a deer entered my yard and startled me.  When I looked back, I could no longer see them.}"

Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the plane lights wavering behind the tree&apos;s as the aircraft approached. I had assumed that it was a plane anyways.  I sat at the glass door for a moment, watching the lights approach as I usually did- out of habit more than anything.As the seconds passed, I noticed that the aircraft seemed to be rising forward into the air at an accelerating velocity- one that seemed almost unusually fast.  I continued to watch in curiosity.  In less than a second, the aircraft made a 390 degree turn, a full circle and then off to the right. There was no way it could be a plane, so I ran outside to see it better.As it flew above the tree-line, I noticed that the lights didn&apos;t look anything like the ones on a plane and the shape of the vehicle was extremely unusual.  The lights were not sharp and pronounced, but instead were hazy and burned like fire, scattered about the bottom and sides of the UFO. They were pale yellow to bluish-green in color and seemed to be linked by thinner lines of light.The UFO itself was not a sleek thin design like I might have imagined it to be.  The main body appeared dark grey and semi-metallic (it reminded me of silicon) and pyramidal, but had abstract shaped parts attached to the main body, creating a shape that is nearly indiscernible to describe from such a short observation period.It continued off to the right for a moment before all of the lights on the aircraft immediately shut off.  I could still see the body due to light pollution and a faint glow that seemed to radiate from the UFO, preventing it from becoming completely hidden.  It changed course in a matter of milliseconds and accelerated again in a sharp upward direction before it was out of eyesight.I watched for a little longer and saw something that made me almost laugh in awe.  What I could see to be as several military fighter jets came into my sight only moments later, uniformly chasing in the same direction I had seen the unidentified aircraft travel before disappearing.

Ive checked star maps and i can see nothign indicating a star or planet anywhere near this brightness in the sky in that direction. Its really creeping me out!   Before a month ago ive never seen it before and ive lived here for my whole life, and after the first sighting, it dissapeared for a full week (i scanned the sky every night for hours) and re appeared exactly one week later at almost the exact same time and has been out almost every day since, with the exception of it dissapearing a couple times and re appearing later.((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter sighting.

20100826,8/26/2010,20100826,8/26/2010, Chicago, IL,IL,USA,Midwest, sphere,1 min,1,60,very short,"Strange Craft Descends from Sky in Chicago and exits the night sky rapidly to the North EastOn 8/26/2010 at 9:03pm CST I witnessed a UFO through my deck sliding glass doorway. I was looking out the window in a north east direction and contemplating taking my telescope out to view the night sky as the moon was very bright in the eastern sky low above the trees. I was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia when there was a bright star that began to descend from the constellation. As it descend it got brighter and very large then began to move in a north eastern direction rapidly.  The total experience was less than 1 minute.Background: I often lay on my couch watching television and look out a 6&rsquo;wide by 10&rsquo; high sliding glass patio doorway.  When looking out the sliding glass doors I am facing in a north eastern direction.  My wife and I live somewhat near the O&rsquo;Hare Airport and are in the direct line of incoming and outgoing air traffic.  So, I am very familiar with aircraft and their appearance both in daylight and dark night skies.  I have seen aircraft flying low and high and feel I can tell the difference between aircraft and what I saw on 8/26/2010 at 9:03pm.9:03pm 8/26/2010: I had spent the evening noticing how the sky was clear and how the moon was very bright and low in the eastern sky. At approximately 8:50pm CST I noticed a bright star below the moon and wondered if it was a planet.  I took a walk back into a spare room where I keep my 10&rdquo; Orion Dobsonian Telescope. But as it was going to be too much trouble to take it out of the storage closet I decided against it.  I walked back to the living room and lay upon the couch and was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia and noticed that from out of view above the sliding glass door a star was getting brighter and looked as though it was descending directly from the constellation. Over the next few second the star got very large, bright white and began to slow its descent. At this point I called for my wife in our bedroom reading a book to please look out the window, as the bedroom window are on the same north eastern facing wall.  She said she could not see a thing, as I assumed she had alrea! dy closed the drapes as she always does. As this conversation was happening the object had gotten very large and stopped descending. It was at a magnitude I have never witnessed before.  My wife did come out of the room and asked what I wanted her to see, as my request was unusual and I was shocked at what was happening and I think she could hear that in my voice.  I continued to observe the object and it got suddenly got very bright and moved in a north easterly direction rapidly.   When she joined me at the sliding glass door, I pointed out the object and she said &ldquo;you mean that star&rdquo;.  When my wife said &ldquo;you mean that star&rdquo;, the object had already become about an 15th of its largest size and had moved out and away from us. It moved rapidly and then disappeared into the sky in that same direction.  She said it probably was plane, but she had not witnessed the full event.Conclusion: In the two years I have been living here and observing the night sky and passage of commercial planes I have never witnessed anything like this before.  The object I saw was round and moved like nothing I had ever seen before.  It descended rapidly from what appeared to be a small star to a large round object. It hovered for a second before rapidly moving out of sight.  There were no blinking lights on the object like on the commercial craft that fly overhead constantly.  And as this was a clear night I am an amateur astronomer I cannot identify what it was that I witnessed. My only conclusion would be to say that this was an UFO.}"

I took a drink of coffee, lit a smoke, then looked directly overhead. it was exactly 8:52 pm the sun was behind the garage to the west and I saw between the branches of the trees above me what looked like a star, &quot;which never moved&quot;, to early for a star I thought?  I grabbed my camera CANON REBEL EOS T2i with the Canon 28-135 Ultrasonic EF, I.S. lens and ripped a few shots, then zoomed into the shot on the camera panel to see if it was a star, I saw a definite sphere, I aimed the camera and shot some more, I then decided to get my tripod and 400mm Tamron crap lens. Into the house I run, unravelling the video camera from the tripod, grabbing the 400mm then extending the tripods legs with the object still in the sky, I aimed on auto focus, it locked, so I snapped away. The object then went dim and the auto focus wouldn&rsquo;t take so I switched to manual and focussed and focussed I could barely see the object through the camera when the Probe lit up and I shot again seeing it split into a few pieces, I was so pumped with my heart pounding and I could barely operate the camera.  The object then went dim and I lost it all in the camera and in visual. Just then A freand came in the driveway, I told them I was taking photos of birds.  Later I told freand, and showed her the photos.  Looking at the photos in the computer with the Canon Photo software I noticed there where five shots that were black instead of blue but the object was still visible in the photos, the most interesting thing was near the ending there seemed to be a puff of smoke in a Saturn like ring around a center object then two sets or 4 more spheres come out, here&rsquo;s the 28 pics I took.  The photos are from Raw images, roughly 20 MB, I enhanced and enlarged them for detail.((NUFORC Note:  Source elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))}"

There were three of us in a car heading west on Saginaw Hwy. Person 1 is sitting in the passenger seat, person 2 is driving, and person 3 is sitting in the middle back seat. It was around 8:40PM, the Sun  was just under the horizon almost centered with the road no stars were visible yet. Person 1 noticed a light that was approx. 60-80 degrees vertical, and 100-120 degrees horizontal (90 degrees being centered with the road) which was really high in the sky and could be easily confused as a Star/Planet. At first it was thought to be Mars because of the reddish orange tint. Person 1 announced that there was a light in the sky when he noticed it was to close to be a star/planet, the other two started looking for it. Person 2 located the light, then the two noticed that the light was moving slowly flying in different directions at will and slowing down and resuming speed.  They also witnessed it dim ! until not visible, then fade back in, then faded back out.  Person 3 noticed the light fade back in while simultaneously the other two noticed another light higher and brighter than the original and getting brighter, thinking it was the original. At this point the three thought they were looking at the same light, person 1 and 2 kept saying, &ldquo; It&rsquo;s getting brighter!&rdquo;  Person 3 noticed that he was looking at a different light because the one he was looking at was getting dimmer then disappeared then reappeared then he noticed they were looking higher up in the sky and had to lean forward to see the other light which was really bright. Then person 3 yelled, &ldquo;oh! There&rsquo;s two of them!&rdquo; Person 1 noticed the original light, it took person 2 a little longer to find it because he was driving. We watched the lights move around, and vary in brightness then the brighter 2nd light started to head south, the other light soon followed they accelerated way  faster than we had seen them trav! el previously, and as they flew they faded out.

We had planned to take a short trip across town to visit my mother that evening, and our only vehicle at the time was his motorcycle. As we mounted the bike in the driveway we looked up and in the distance saw three blinding white lights. They weren&apos;t far from the ground; two below and one above in a tight triangle configuration. My fiance was in the Air Force at the time and worked at Wright Paterson on the weekends. &quot;What the Hell is that?&quot; he wondered aloud. &quot;It&apos;s probably just highbeams on a crane&quot; I suggested. We would know soon enough since we had to head in that direction. We drove for about a mile, all the while my ex was saying &quot;What the Hell is that??&quot; Eventually we came close enough to be able to tell that it was too high up to be lights attached to a crane, but they were dead still. Suddenly we noticed that a large rectangular space behind the lights was far darker than the sky around it. My ex yelled &quot;WHAT THE FUCK IS IT??!  Then slammed on his brakes as about six African American kids ranging in age from about ten to sixteen dashed in front of our bike. Their eyes were also fixed on the monstrous craft. And it was bloody huge. Not &quot;Independence day&quot; huge-but easily as large as a football field or larger. It was gunmetal gray; like a giant monolithic slab  about the proportions of a thick cereal box or box of cigarettes with slightly raised and depressed geometric shapes of various sizes on it&apos;s surface (it was not smooth at all). It hovered over a large empty parking lot that stretched out in front of an abandoned Rink&apos;s department stor! e. The road we were on was busy, but I didn&apos;t notice if others had stopped to look. The craft had the three painfully bright lights mounted on what looked like it&apos;s front. There were smaller amber/ red and bluish green lights underneath it that glowed steadily, and as we kept driving we came around to the &quot;back&quot; of the craft, which featured three (maybe four) flat, glowing rectangular panels in a horizontal row that were tilted slightly downward. They looked like large observation windows to me, and I felt-or perhaps even saw-figures moving around inside. I didn&rsquo;t want to see anymore and looked down. My former fiance finally said &quot;We have to get closer!&quot; and I completely flipped out -and I&apos;m not one who is given to &quot;flipping out&quot;. He turned the bike toward the craft and I hit him hard and told him that there was no way in hell that he would take me any closer. I was in tears I was so frightened. Just as this was happening the group of boys that had crossed in front of us co! uld be seen running across the expanse of the parking lot towa! rd the a rea under the craft. As they neared it I glanced down for a second time, not wanting to see what was happening,  and as I did I heard my ex exclaim &quot;Holy Fuck!!&quot; I looked and the kids were standing there, but the craft had disappeared. Ken said that it had shot straight up into the sky at a speed that was simply unbelievable. I begged him to keep driving and we continued on.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although source of report does not indicate that fact.  PD))}"

On the 8th.of August 2010 I looked out of my window and saw in the sky, a light, travelling in a SE. to NW. direction.  I went outside and looked up at the light, it was red to orange in colour and in a figure of eight configuration with the two balls of the eight off set.  I watched this light and when it was almost directly overhead it slowed, stopped, then faded into two little white dots, and disappeared.  I realised that what looked like a single figure of eight shaped light was actually two separate round red lights. On the 14th.of Aug, my wife and I saw a red ball of light come over the Campsie Fells (which are 10 miles distant to the north) and fly towards us in a N. to S. direction.  When at a distance of approximately one quarter of a mile to our left it slowed, stopped, then disappeared.  About 30 seconds later another red light appeared over the Campsie Fells and travelled towards us, it slowed then stopped at exactly the same spot as did the first. This went on at very regular intervals for some time, red lights travelling towards us, stopping and then disappearing. Although I didn&apos;t time them, the lights took about one and a half minutes to travel the 10miles from the Campsie Fells.Later that night I looked over towards the Kilsyth Hills which are really a continuation of the Campsie fells and saw a red light, then another come over these hills and disappear at some distance from us.There is no way these lights could be Chinese lanterns.

As I continued to investigate, it slowly -- and at a deliberate and even pace - traversed east across the moon.I got the sense I was witnessing something quite unique and even though it sounds mundane as I type this, it was truly awesome as it stretched as far north and south as the eye could see.  It was geometrically perfect, narrowing at both ends.  If I had to guess at what it might be, I could only say that I believe it was a deliberate mass of something that had a specific purpose.As it arrived close to the moon and was about to cross it, I could determine it was approximately twice as wide as the moon, and as it traveled east and away from the moon, it got dimmer until I could no longer make out the outline.NOTE: I am a frequent sky watcher, C2C listener and have observed (and filmed) many unexplained phenomena and I have never seen anything like this before.}"

The sky was clear, with a full moon illuminating the sky considerably.While looking at the moon we witnessed a very bright, solid white, orb-like object float into our field of view.  We don&rsquo;t know where it originated from as it seemed to have simply appeared.As we watched the light, we witnessed it accelerate fluidly and slow down just the same.  The object was able to make left, right, up, and down movements while changing altitudes quickly.  This object was totally silent, and it traversed the length of our house, but must have been at least a couple of miles away.  The light then moved behind the trees just behind our house.  Yet, being as bright as it was, we were still able to maintain visual contact and track its movement.  We were at this point standing on my neighbor&rsquo;s porch, my girlfriend on my right, when the object vanished.  Simultaneously, a shooting white light shot off into space faster than lightening.  The light trail was almost imperceptible to the eye, and it&rsquo;s duration a fraction of a second.  Almost like a reverse shooting star.At this point, we were stunned because we knew it was like nothing we had ever seen.  As we sat and discussed the object/light, we continued watching the sky. It couldn&rsquo;t have been mo re than 5 or ten minutes since the other object vanished when we began to see multiple high-altitude aircraft flying towards the area where the object had been.  These aircraft made no sound, and had blue and red quick flashing/blinking lights.  These lights flashed quickly and they appeared to be set in a rectangular shape or pattern.  One after another, these aircraft continued to appear at what looked like the same altitude and speed; the latter being hard to estimate.  At one point, it appeared these craft were assuming a triangular formation or were flying in a formation directly above where we witnessed the first object.I estimate seeing at least 10 of these aircraft, and I do not believe these were commercial aircraft.  I think it&rsquo;s possible they were military in nature, and that they also may have been circling the area.

The sky was so clear that you could see the stars in the sky.  My friend and I were outside on the deck talking (our husbands were there as well) and we both looked up and saw something flying in the sky just above the trees.  The object was flying quite fast.  It flew across the sky and we followed it with our eyes for about 10 seconds and then it disappeared right before our eyes.  Right after it happened, we talked about it and both described the same thing that we saw and heard flying in the sky.  We both saw this object that had two circular lights perpendicular to each other.  The lights were not bright, they were almost like a very faint colored light.  We also both heard a humming sound as well, it almost sounded like a machine (something that we both never heard before).  It was a very strange object that we&rsquo;ve both never seen before and we both decided that it definitely wasn&rsquo;t a plane because first o! f all, it didn&rsquo;t sound like a plane.  Second of all, no plane that we&rsquo;ve ever seen had lights that close together.  Although our husbands didn&apos;t see it or hear it, my friend and I decided that it was an UFO.  We were also talking about that night and my friend, husband and I all said that we felt as though the time frame of that evening were a little strange.  My husband said he looked at the clock at about 2230 hrs and then before he knew it, it was already 0130 hrs.  I also said that I looked at the clock at 2300 hrs and then the next time I looked it was 0130 hrs.  My friend said she looked at the clock at 0015 hrs and before she knew it, it was 0130 hrs.  It just felt like too much time had passed within those time frames than should have been.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))}"

I was taking pictures when my girlfriend got my attention... at first she thought she saw a police car, but the red and blue lights didn&apos;t flash.  Once the object floated way above any bridge in downtown she knew it was no car.  Thats when she called for me.  I looked at where she was pointing, and instantly knew it was something I had never seen before!  So I pointed my camera and pressed record, but my camera was still set on photo.  So I snapped a quick blurred picture of it before I switched it to video.  I think I got some good footage of the orb floating up, down, and all around until it flickers away into nothing.I still have the raw footage on my camera as evidence to it not being altered with special effects.  I have a simple little digital camera, which would be impossible to add special effects to video on it.The light seemed to be solid blue on one side and solid red on the other.  You can see this as the object moves from side to side.  During the filming I was so excited, I wanted more footage! I am going back tonight 08/16/2010 hoping to see it again.

It was a cloudless night except for a round shape black cloud covering the moon. It did not look like a cloud it looked like smoke. It held its shape and when it dissipated it stayed in one place. The second time was a whole different sighting. I was on my patio in back of the house and it was dusk, sun was below the horizon but still plenty of light. To the west I saw one again. It got darker and was not solid, like a round cloud but not like a cloud within the circle. It was not perfectly round. Sorta like a mortar firework puff. Anyway, it dissipated slowly in the same place. Then another one formed, got darker and looked the same as the first one. But then I saw a little black dot like like a pencil point travel from the cloud that was going away and where it stopped another one formed. It formed there then the dot moved and another one formed. When they dissipated it ! was over.There was a branch on the neighbors yard and a limb with leaves stuck out closely to the right of this happening and it all happened in exactly the same place. I searched the internet. I was about to give up seeing anything about this, then I saw a pic of one up close and it is amazing. Shows black strands, not straight, that were real black.

We passed the silver mine pond on the left and then the road took a small dip. I was going fairly slow, about 25 mph as to avoid deer.  About a &frac12; mile after we passed the silver mine parking lot we saw bright lights to the right as we approached a slight left turn.  I slowed down a little to about 5-10 mph so we could get a better look at what we saw.  About 50 feet out over a small lake we saw 6-8 red and green lights in a row formation about 10 feet long, just over the surface of the lake. As we got closer the lights moved at a somewhat brisk pace to the right on the water&rsquo;s surface and turned off sequentially from left to right.  We only saw the lights for about 4 seconds before they disappeared completely.  There were no boats in the lake that either of us could see.  I don&rsquo;t think there is a launch on that particular lake either.  We had the windows closed but there was no noticeable noise. We didn&rsquo;t stop to turn around but instead drove onwards past other lakes but saw nothing over any of those. I told family members what I saw but no one had an explanation other than maybe a small boat someone was fishing off of. I know I didn&rsquo;t see a boat though.

This time there was fear in her voice as it was wavering in tone, and that got my attention, we have been married for ten years and I know her well.So I now was shifting my line of sight from the road ahead to the sky and back.And for the briefest moment, as if seeing traces of light from lamps that were just switching off, I saw it too. They seemed to be yellow in color, and in rows, dotting the triangular shape,  the shape seemed longer at one end.And then it was gone.Just after, I asked her to grab my TX-1 video camera, because if this thing comes back I want to be ready. And she too got her camera and was at the ready watching the night sky. But it did not come back.When we arrived at the house in Volcano, I asked her to draw something of what she had seen.I confirmed the shape too. Except it was with the front point facing down instead of up when I saw it. There was also a sort of criss-crossing frame between the lights that you could just make out.In the following days what we had seen kept popping up in our conversations.

This formation passed directly overhead and as i! t passed directly overhead the lights went out in intensity like a candle would go out, until the lights disappeared.

20070807,8/7/2007,20100811,8/11/2010, Erie, PA,PA,USA,Northeast, fireball,over one hour,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,#VALUE!,"Orange Flaming Orbs fall from the sky over Lake Erie, August, 2007The Event occurred during a late summer rain storm. Although the rain was not heavy, the dark cloud over Lake Erie was distinct. The phenomena observed began as a casual observance of a single speck of light. We observed what appeared from the shoreline as a light perhaps a mile or two offshore. The only way we could observe this occurence was with an average powered pair of field binoculars. At first looking through the binoculars it appeared as if it might be a small boat, but closer examination revealed that this was something &quot;on fire&quot;. I quickly alerted my companion to look into the binoculars to get his opinion. He also saw this ball of flame. What happened after this first encounter was quite startling. Let me say that I have never had a close encounter and am suspect of anything currently being written about the UFO phenomenology. However the unfolding events of that night have not only startled me, but have stayed with me for the last three years. O! nly today was I able to define my observances based on other eye-witnesses who had similar sightings. They have described what they similarly saw as &quot;orange flaming orbs&quot;. Other descriptions were ascribed to them, but in my case the &quot;orange flaming orbs&quot; fits the description perfectly. I thought that one orb appearance was enough, but what makes this an even more intriguing mystery is that after this first orb disappeared beyond the Lake Erie&apos;s horizon line, another one began to fall from the low hanging dark storm cloud.I have read other accounts and descriptions of &quot;ascending lights&quot; and fast lateral moving lights but these were not like that at all. We watched as consecutive flaming orbs fell very slowly from the sky and eventually into the water. What is also amazing is how each was orchestrated in its falling velocity (extremely slow-- slower than a parachutist, so we knew this wasn&apos;t a nighttime military mission) and also that the intensity of the light stayed consistent-- from the time it appeared coming out of the dark cloud until it hit the water&apos;s horizon line. I should note that there were no sounds being emitted and no sounds of jets, airplane or helicopter engines were heard. The fact that it was a drizzling rain (with no lightning, I might add) made it impossible for this to be man-made-- such as what I thought it might be: a summer &quot;art performance&quot; by some of the local artists. No one in their right mind would want to be out in this weather on the vastness of Lake Erie. No ot! her lights appeared-- suche as boats or planes. The house we observed all of this from is remote from the city so no street, traffic or building lights could have interfered.As much as I am recreating this story, we unfortunately had no access to good night time cameras or videos, but I would testified unequivocally that this was a phenomena that deserved a full and further investigation. To continue with the observation, we stood on the back porch with a full panoramic view to the west toward Cleveland and to the east toward Buffalo. We were facing north toward Canada when these lights were observed. In the same fashion as described earlier, we observed at least 16 of these same flaming orbs extremely slowly fall from the sky and into the waters. As each one disappeared the next one began to come out from the underside of the cloud. This event went on for at least one hour. There were more that continued to fall and perhaps a whole string of them from our line of sight and down toward Buffalo, but I actually felt frightened (amazed and excited as well) and wanted to report this occurance to the Lawrence Park police, but being a skeptic and resp! ectful of this tiny suburb and being late at night I hesitated to call anyone to bring undo attention to the neighborhood. I looked in the Erie Times News the next day to see if there was a story about this light phenomena, but did not find anything, nor was there anything on the television. This event has stayed with me since 2007. It is only today that I found your reporting website and also found better descriptors based on other observances.}"

Moments later a commercial aircraft on the normal flight path into Glasgow Airport (Scotland) passed overhead.  Given that the two literally crisscrossed each other, I&rsquo;d be amazed if the flight crew of the aircraft didn&rsquo;t see the orange light I saw as it would have been passing left to right from their point of view.I stopped my vehicle and spoke to another car driver parked outside a shop.  I asked if he could see the light I&rsquo;d seen, and he confirmed he had.I returned to my car and drove about 300-yards to my home and I then stood outside my home and looked to see if I could spot the light again.  Minutes later a light appeared , again going in a south to north direction.  Once again the light passed to my left (northwards) the light dimmed then disappeared.I waited for about five minutes, searching the sky from horizon to horizon and suddenly I saw two orange lights, one following the other some distance apart but both going in the same direction high in the sky, south to north (right to left from my viewpoint), again as they reached the left of me (north) the lights faded then dimmed to nothing.This fading convinces me that the light was shining at the front of the object and I could see no light from the rear of any of them.These lights made no noise I was aware of and the weather conditions were clear in a bright sky with no wind.I have no idea what I saw but I&rsquo;m convinced these were not these floating Chinese lanterns I&rsquo;ve read about recently, nor were they any recognisable aircraft.Help!!((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

20100806,8/6/2010,20100812,8/12/2010, Peabody, MA,MA,USA,Northeast, disk,10 seconds,10,10,very short,"Silver disk flew over my backyard, directly overhead, low and slow.On the afternoon of August 6, 2010, I was on a lounge chair in my backyard on the north side of the swimming pool. It was 2:40 pm on a sunny day with a mostly blue sky dotted with a few puffy clouds.  I was facing east and was in the shade cast by the tall bamboo behind me.  Although there was no change in the light, I had a random thought that dark thunderclouds might be coming in from the west and looked up at the sky.  A few seconds later I saw a silver disk travelling from west to east, in a straight line over my pool almost directly overhead.At first glance I thought it was some kid&apos;s silver balloon that got loose but quickly realized it was no floppy, tinfoil balloon, but some kind of solid, firm-surfaced metal. I focused in on it so I could remember as much detail as possible. It was shaped like a disk but also had a squashed circle/egg type shape. The top and bottom were rounded and the sides were slightly rounded, like the shape of a Mento candy. There were no hard edges or seams, no puckers or variations of color or texture in the surface. It was totally smooth and reflective, the bottom of it turning darker as it passed over the green trees at the eastern end of the yard. I&apos;m estimating that it was about 30 feet above the fully mature maple trees, so maybe 60 feet above ground. I got the impression that it might be 3 to 4 feet in diameter. Although it was breezy at the treetops, the disk moved in a straight line, with no side to side wavering or drifting from the wind, and no change in altitude. There! was absolutely no sound emitting from it.After the disk had been in my sight for about 5 seconds I had the presence of mind to call out, &quot;Look up!&quot; to my husband, who was doing some yard work about 20 feet behind me and to the right. Since he was to the right of the edge of the bamboo stand he had a clear view of the disk and looked up in time to see it just as it was going over the trees. His description of the disk corroborated mine. From the time I saw the disk to the time it travelled out of sight was about 8 to 10 seconds and I estimate that the distance it travelled in that time was about 50 to 60 feet. Using these estimates, the disk was travelling at about 3 to 5 miles per hour. Unfortunately there was no time to take a picture, even with my cell phone.I am recently retired but was a government employee for 33 years and my husband works for a major airline. Our eyesight is fine and neither of us requires eyeglasses or contacts for driving. Immediately following this sighting I felt satisfied to have finally seen something concrete and real because it left no doubt that these objects do exist. Then I started wondering whether the fact that they do exist was a good thing or not. Knowing that there is technology far advanced than that held by us here on Earth is a bit unsettling. From our own history we know what usually happens when a technologically advanced civilization meets a less advanced society. I can only hope that whoever is controlling these objects has a less aggressive nature than us humans.  I am not overly worried about it, though, because I feel that if they meant to do us harm, they would have by now.  Perhaps they are just documenting our own self-destruction, via the proliferation of nuclear weapons, p! ollution, greenhouse gases, over population, genocide, chemical farming, antibiotics, destruction of the rainforests, and over fishing?  Maybe we are their version of watching a demolition derby; dirty, ugly and violent, but oh so entertaining!  We told friends about the sighting but, of course, most of them just laughed it off and asked how much we had been drinking at the time (which, by the way, was not at all). We humans do laugh when we are nervous about something, and we don&apos;t want to hear about something that makes us uncomfortable. And the quickest way to shut someone up is to ridicule them. So our friends reactions are normal, but we know what we saw. I don&apos;t think our government could keep such technology a secret. Even if they could, if we had it, we wouldn&apos;t be fighting wars to get oil because we would have a better propulsion system already. So what we saw was an Object, that was Flying and is Unidentified...a UFO.}"

I did not know or notice the object at the time I took the pictures. This is another explation.I did notice the object when I downloaded the pictures while in Germany.  It was only a few days ago (5 Aug 10) that a co-worker and myself were browsing pictures of Germany from 2008.  We looked at this picture and magnified it to 800x to get a better look at it.  It is our belief that the object is not an airplane, helicopter or any type of aviation device known to humans.  There are no wings, tail, nose or rotary blades.  There is a black haze/mist around the object.  We also noticed that the object had an indention close to the top of the object that might appear to be windows or some type of design that&apos;s indented on the object.  The indentation goes aroun! d the object also.  I have two pictures that were taken back to back.  One of the pictures does not have the object in it.  The pictures were taken about 1 to 2 seconds apart.  I wish that I had noticed and investigated this back in 2008.  I have never seen anything like this before.  I was also of sound mind when taking the pictures.  I did not hear anything while taking the pictures.  I was looking at a direction of South/Southeast (approximately 2700 - 2800 mills).  When taking the two pictures, there were trees in the background, a river in front of me (Danube River) two church steeples and a walking path below me.  The Cathedral in downtown Regensburg was approximately 1 to 1 1/2 miles away in a direct line.  The sky that day was pretty clear with some clouds.  It was not raining anywhere around the area.}"

I was walking east towards the ocean, and was passing the firehouse when several people out front had already noticed the lights and were discussing what they could be.This is not the first time I have seen these lights.

Hi I&apos;m a homeowner / observer from  .... yep, Gulf Breeze FL .  I have a report on a recent sighting that should match up with other reports in the area.  I&apos;m confident at least 50-100 people would have seen the same thing, to include my neighbor as a witness.Taking out the trash at approx 5:40pm Jan 13, 2010..  looking north from &quot;midway&quot; towards Escambia Bay, I saw a bright white/orange-tinted ( about -6 magnitude brightness ) spherical light-form traveling East from Garson Point Bridge towards Eglin AFB&apos;s West boundary at a rate of approx 500knts.  As it approached the middle of the bay, about 3-4 seconds since I noticed the object, it made a downward 180 degree turn at the same rate of speed.  I dropped the garbage bag in the driveway, and knew that what I was seeing was not anything in our publicly known aviation inventory. My view was obscured from about 15 degrees from the horizon to the top of the tree line to my North. The object would dive below and above the trees moving in a very similar pattern as a dragonfly. After approx. 2 minutes of viewing I was able to signal my neighbor to be a witness.. after about a minute or two the object shot skyward from it&apos;s last position below the tree line as if it were staying in ! a particular piece of airspace in the middle of the bay, approx 1/2 mile wide and below 4000ft.  I should also mention there was a thin cloud layer around 5000ft which helped me judge the distance and scale of the light sphere.  At times the object would traverse and incredible speeds, well in excess of mach2-3 without breaking the sound barrier and without making any audible sound from approx 1mi away.  Traffic from Hwy98 was audible as well as several single engine recreational aircraft off in the distance, west and south of the activity, approx 8-15 miles. The last maneuver the object made was from west to east it climbed to approx 4000ft, turned north, &ldquo;zig-zagged&rdquo; in an S pattern and vanished after the 3rd &ldquo;zag&rdquo;, not to be seen again.Shortly after a single rotor helicopter came on site ( pursuit ) from west to east along the original path of the sphere, and turned north toward Whiting Field NAS.  No other aircraft approached the area except for a commercial flight leaving PNS traveling North-East, which tells me the airspace was not locked down.  I was under the impression that this object wanted to show-off and be seen.  Also another observation was 3 satellites at 90 degrees elevation, magnitude about +4, intersecting directly above shortly after the sighting.I&apos;m still in awe over this observation.  I&apos;m very familiar with military aviation and aeronautical engineering.  This sphere was defying our physics somehow by moving through the atmosphere at those speeds without disturbing the air.  Most Impressive.}"

This happened on the outskirts of Lowell, in one of the more suburban areas along Andover St.At approximately 9:30 PM I went outside to take the trash out.  It was raining pretty hard and I remember it being exceptionally dark that night.  I walked out the front door with the bag of trash and around the back of our house.  As I turned the corner from the side of the house to the back, I saw a huge, round, red light hovering in the sky almost directly above me.  It seemed really close- maybe JUST  above the trees (and certainly below the clouds), but it made absolutely NO sound.It was large. if you hold a small paper plate at arm&rsquo;s length in front of you while looking at the sky, that&rsquo;s about the size.  The light was deep red, like a stop light, and in the 20 seconds I watched it, it didn&rsquo;t flicker, fade, or pulse.  It was solid.  I remember thinking how strange it was that it was just glowing with no portion of the circle being any brighter than another and had no different characteristics - just one massive, solid, glowing orb in the sky.At some point, I looked away to drop the trash into the barrel I&rsquo;d been standing next to, and when I looked back, the orb was gone.  I waited a few more seconds to see if it would return, but it didn&rsquo;t.It&rsquo;s been 20 years since it happened and I STILL think about it all the time, as if it just happened yesterday.  Every so often I search the net but have never found much until now, when I found NUFORC.  Reading through this site, just the Massachusetts section alone, I can&rsquo;t believe how many people have had similar experiences.On a side note, for reference purposes, the accounts I&rsquo;ve read from July 4th 2010 and the subsequent videos all over Youtube from that night are very similar to what I experienced, except, in my case, the single orb was red, didn&rsquo;t move and seemed closer to the ground (just due to the size difference).((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

I looked up at it and it was unusual in both color and shape. The ambient noise made it impossible to determine if there was any associated engine noise, but the object was indeed unusual. For the time that we observed it, it moved several times. The impression was that it was demonstrating an interest in the fire works, and we discussed the possibility of it being a helicopter or balloon/dirigible observing the firework display.  My son pointed out that the lighting was not correct for either.  Upon conclusion of the firework display, the object traveled quite fast to the east where we lost sight of it.  We then walked over to a local dinner approximately a 15-minute walk.  Before entering the dinner, I looked back in the direction of where the object had been and it had returned.

When I returned my attention to the star, I found that it had moved Westward and toward the horizon significantly.  We then watched its motions for several minutes, noting first to ourselves and then aloud that the object was swinging strangely from side to side.  This seemed curious especially due to its apparent distance from us.  If the presumed object seemed to us the size of a very bright star and it was performing such wide swinging motions and there was only a slight breeze that night, I assumed this might not be a conventional aircraft or an object being manipulated by air currents.Thinking the rapid movements of our eyes may have caused this pattern of movement, I scanned the sky for a star and attempted to produce the same affects but could not.  The motion seemed to be real and not a product of autokinesis.We procured my Meade ETX-70AT Telescope upon my boyfriend&apos;s suggestion.  Magnification did not clarify any apparent shape of the object.  At times it is obscured by clouds.

It was a night flight, I&rsquo;m not sure what time it was specifically, but a lot of passengers were sleeping.  I&rsquo;m not sure  what area of the country we were flying over at the time, but my daughter observed some bright lights below, outside the plane window.She was 10, an elementary student, at the time, sitting on the right side of the plane (if facing the front), and I was 35, a police officer, sitting on the aisle.  My boyfriend, who was in the Navy over 30 yrs, and a fire fighter for over 30 yrs, looked out the window and also saw these lights.  I leaned over her to look out the window and I too saw these bright lights below at ground level.  To me, the way I can describe it, was it appeared as if transformers on the ground were exploding, then fading&hellip;so a bright blast of light, fast, moving along with the plane.  But there were several flashing at once, and in different sizes of flash, some small and some really big, and it was on the ground, and going about the same speed as the plane, just slightly trailing behind the plane.We were probably at about 35,000 feet and about 400-500 knots, the average flying speed and height.  The night sky was clear and the moon was out.  At first we thought they may be a bunch of transformers blowing up below, but there is no way that many would do that, and if they did, there wouldn&rsquo;t be any other lights on in the little cities/towns we were flying over.  Then I thought maybe we&rsquo;re flying over a bunch of little ponds and lakes, and it was the reflection of the moon on the water.  But then we&rsquo;d pass a highway or a large lake, and you would see the lights all the way up to the highway or lake and then they would jump over to the other side, fast.   And the reflection of the moon on the water was distinctly different.  These lights wouldn&rsquo;t flash over the water or highways.  When we would pass over a tree/wooded area, we could see these bright lights light up the trees.  If we passed over neighborhoods with street lights, you could see these bright lights light up th! e immediate areas where they were.Then we asked some other passengers to look, they saw what we saw.  We even had a retired air force pilot look.  He said he&rsquo;s seen some strange things in his air time, but nothing like that.  No one seemed concerned, but we all kept watching.This phenomenon occurred for about 30 minutes, that we had timed it, then just stopped.  Who knows when it started.  So, something on the ground, or just above it, was moving fast enough to keep up with a jet/passenger plane, and bright enough to light up the areas around it&hellip;and several at once.I just wanted to know if anyone else had reported anything like this that same night.}"

While sitting in front of my home, I noticed a very bright white light whith a red hue low in the western sky.  At first I thought it was a low flying plane, as there is a small airport nearby.  But then I noticed it wasn&apos;t really moving. It was hard to determine if it was in our atmosphere or in space.  Then I began to think perhaps it was a very bright star or planet, but it just seemed too big for that and the red hue didn&apos;t make sense.  I couldn&apos;t really determine what it might be. I called to my wife and a visting friend who witnessed it as well. Star, plant, plane; they came to the same conclusion as me.  I called a neighbor and he and his family witnessed it as well. They had a pair of binoculars and ! indicated that it was round with a red hue.  They could not determine if it was in our atmosphere or not.  We watched it for about 15-20 minutes, and then it made an apparent wobble to the left and the white light disappeared.  You could then see a faint red twinkling hue in it&apos;s place.  At one point, about 3-4 min. following the bright light&apos;s disappearance, there was another flash or shimmer resembling the largewhite light that lasted about 2 seconds.  I watched the red twinkling hue for another 5-10 minutes before clouds moved in and obscured my view completely.  I live in North Asheville, and called a friend in South Asheville to see if he had noticed the light.  He, in fact, had noticed it while driving home, and had thought it to be an oddly large, bright planet.  He suggested that perhaps it was a large meteor.  I called the local paper shortly after to see if anyone else had reported it, but no one had at that time.}"

I have worked in aviation for over 20 years and have seen a lot of aircraft so I asked them if they wanted to see something interesting. As we walked outside we noticed two more behind these, then two more seemingly flying in pairs but fairly evenly spaced overall. The moon was partially obscured in the western sky but there were few clouds and the winds were calm.The string of lights were yellowish-orange in colour, somewhat like the sodium street lamps in our neighbourhood. They were slowly pulsing and as they travelled at what would appear to be aircraft takeoff and climb speeds (200-300 knots), they turned to a more northerly course and faded out. There were no visible beacons or other lights on the objects (what caught my attention in the first place).  I ran inside to get my phone to see if it could record the event on video, but the quality was too poor to detect the lights and only recorded our commentary.As I came back outside we watched in amazement as the count increased to eight, then ten and finally twelve with about six visible at any one time (the others had turned north and faded out in sequence).  We noticed that they appeared to be climbing from the Georgetown area to the west and did not all follow the exact same course, some turning north before others did.  I observed one passing behind a cloud and then emerging again just before fading out completely and none of them ever stopped pulsing, they just appeared to dim as they got farther away.  I thought they must be helicopters to have maintained their formation so I asked my daughter to run in and shut off the air conditioning but there was no detectable sound so they may have been too far away.I could see no other aircraft in the immediate airspace, but saw one to the south heading north (presumably from Pearson International Airport) that may have observed them.  After the last light faded away, an aircraft flew overhead with the familiar beacons of a passenger jet and it was obvious to all of us that these lights in the sky appeared to be something different.}"

The light wasn&rsquo;t as bright as Jupiter but not as dim as a satellite moving in the sky. I yelled for my Great Niece to come out and see.We stood there for 15 minutes watching the light. It would move in spirals, zigzag, and linear, then would appear to remain in one spot with a quiver to it. The light stayed constant in intensity never changing its brightness. I flashed my LED flashlight at it to see if any response but it did nothing, I don&rsquo;t think my light could have been visible from any distance anyway.

It was a beautiful, clear night with no moon.  Jupiter was hanging high over head and slightly to the south at this hour.  There were several nice meteors, two brilliant ones of note, but the rest were just tiny little streaks.  I was getting a little bit bored with looking at the same section of sky so I looked back over towards the South.  I could see Jupiter shining through the fabric of the sunshade but off to the side of the shade and directly overhead, I noticed a bright, smaller, pale, bluish, white light.  I was confused since I knew it wasn&apos;t another planet and I hadn&apos;t remembered seeing a star that was that bright. As pondered this anomaly, it just slowly faded out.  While my eyes adjusted tracking around it&apos;s position, I then got this bizarre motion sensation which really bugged me out since I was sitting stationary.  I realized then that it wasn&apos;t me that! was moving, it was a tiny light that my eye had fixed upon, it was no brighter than the background stars, and it was moving slowly towards the South.  That&apos;s when I noticed it wasn&apos;t alone.  There were two distinct, small points of light moving perfectly in unison together with one ahead of the other at a slight angle from my perspective, there was a decent gap between the two, about an inch and a half to two inches if you measured between two fingers of an outstretched hand.   A jet flying at a high altitude with it&apos;s standard running lights flashing also happened to fly overhead a moment later, but towards the East at a completely perpendicular angle to the lights.  I don&apos;t think the jet&apos;s appearance was related, as I could tell it (the jet) was much, much closer that the lights.  What ever I was seeing had to be at an extremely high altitude, possibly in orbit or possibly in outer space.  I honestly don&apos;t know what I saw tonight but it just gave me the chills.  I thought, maybe it was two objects at first, but then I wondered, what! if it w as just one, extremely long object that was dimly illuminated at either end?  I&apos;ve seen a few weird things in my life, but nothing like this.  Please don&apos;t think I&apos;m crazy, I&apos;m usually pretty skeptical about these things, but to actually see it with my own eyes...  I don&apos;t know what else to say.

Later, I looked up Airships on the internet and found out that there are many types of airships nowadays and that some are even shaped like ! sauser ufos and that they now have passenger rides on airships and that companies make personal airships for people customized to whatever shape or design they want.  Also learned that the Army has made one the size of a football field to do spy work over Aphghanistan and saw a picture of another unmanned spy airship that looks like a ufo.

It was about twice the size of Venus (as it appears during this time of year).  At first I thought maybe it was an abnormally bright light on top of a radio tower or that it was Venus but since it was larger, brighter and had a steady glow, I started to think maybe it was a plane or helicopter falling from the sky...  It looked like a ball of fire and it moved at a slow, steady speed downwards toward the horizon (I stopped my car for a moment to make sure it was actually moving).  Then it gradually started to move diagonally towards the north, then almost completely parallel to the horizon and then down until I could no longer see it because of trees on the horizon.While I have no idea how large it was or how far away it was, it was about 40 degrees from the eastern horizon when we first saw it.  It also had a steady glow, didn&apos;t twinkle or fade out or anything.  Just stayed a constant brightness comparable to Venus&apos;s but white with a slightly orange outline and an almost burning appearance (which might not make it a steady glow... but it didn&apos;t flicker or anything.  It just seemed to &quot;boil&quot; slightly as a ball engulfed in flames would).I considered the idea that it could be something someone had shot into the air, like some sort of firework that came falling to the ground but it appeared to be very far away and thus would be quite large (I&apos;m not sure if you can really measure the distance of something with no idea what the object is... or how large it is... so this guess is based on the fact that the trees in the horizon were probably a mile away or so).}"

I have a pair of fairly high powered binoculars that I keep in my car at all times.  We have witnessed several obvious disks wobbling/zigzagging through the sky on multiple occasions in this area, but never anything like what we witnessed on this night.It was a very dark and moonless night.  I was scanning the treeline with my binoculars while my friend observed with his eyes.  Through my binoculars I noticed a cluster of several hexagonal yellow lights. This was not a constellation, or any star formation.  It immediately stunned me because I am very familiar with the area as I go there all the time, it is one of the best places to see the sky clearly close to Morgantown.  I got my friend&apos;s attention and observed it with my naked eye. It was a large, quarter size at arm&apos;s length, cluster of hexagonal lights blinking on and off.   We could not tell for sure if this was several objects hovering together, or lights on a larger craft, but it did appear that it was a singular craft as we were both able, through binoculars, to see smaller objects flying around the craft.  Both of us felt frightened by what we saw.   We observed the object for about 25 minutes. It never moved suddenly or swiftly but it did appear to be getting smaller and! farther away as the sighting went on.   Eventually, we left as it was getting late.  The object was still observable when we headed home.I do want to remain totally anonymous, as I never report the objects we witness in that area, but I decided to submit this account because it was an especially startling sighting and unlike anything I or my friend had seen before.  I believe that one only has to seek these things out in order to witness them, because this kind of activity seems to be happening all the time.((NUFORC Note:  Source  elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It started with a holographic image of a sniper soldeir that I still don&rsquo;t understand why I saw this it must mean they are working  with the government.  I walked past this and the next thing I saw was a green lazer beam flash me in the left eye just like the ones you can buy at the store.  Then a red light scaned my body from head to waist.  The next image and the only one that matters is of an ailen spider type being.  It had nearly twenty straight legs and it was as tall as hip leavel,.  It moved its legs up and down making  sucktion type sounds.  Its body after the legs was only a foot and a half tall but three feet wide.  What I did when I witnessed the creature was a little embarrassing but I fell to all fours bringin me eye level with the creature.  I did this partially for a better view, partially in awe and respect for seeing something so advanced, and because it was so disgusting at first to see too.  I think these certain aliens who must watch us closely are so advanced that you will NEVER SEE there SPACE SHIP but if you prove yourself interesting they may show up right in front of you or an image of them was there.((NUFORC Note:  Student report.

It happpened on September 21, 1986 around 6:30 a.m.  I was in the bed fixing to get up to go to school (the 6th grade).  My mom woke me up all upset saying she dreamed of a tornado.  She woke up and looked outside and saw a UFO.  She said it was low on the ground making a beeping noise like it was in trouble and changed colors.  Suddenly it took off.  I laughed at her and said, &quot;yeah right&quot;.  I got up and looked out the window.  It was back!  I saw it too!  My body was in complete shock and couldn&apos;t move.  I saw that it was about 3 feet hovering above the ground, and it looked like a triangular shape.  It was a solid white color for a few seconds.  It didn&apos;t make a noise when I saw it.  It was next to our big tree and mail box about 3 feet above ground on our dirt road (back then it was very remote).  Then it changed colors from white to red and took off and dissappeared with a second! ! I got the courage to go outside to try and find evidence.  I couldn&apos;t find anything and went back in the house.  I know it had to be something (either something from the government, a real UFO, or who knows).  I still think about it till this day.  It changed the way I think about things now.  I still believe in God, but I do think of things more scientifically as well.  I forgot the camera because I was in total shock!  I truly thought in my mind that they may know if I took their picture.  I certainly didn&apos;t want to be killed at 11 years old.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))}"

There was a small mowed yard on my right surrounded by small trees. As you drive east past the trees at the end of the small yard there is a field on the right side of the road and still trees on the left side.  There is a very nice house built in this field by its self.At 21:00 on 12/22/2009 as I was driving east along the small yard when I noticed threw the tree to the east in front of me what look like to me at the time two sparks from a bonfire rising into the air and rolling over the top away from me like they were gliding on the wind.   I saw this twice before I pass the trees. When I passed the trees and entered the edge of the field looking now south. I saw that what I thought was sparks was to small lights.  They seemed to be flying in perfect formation. One would rise into the sky and the other would follow in perfect sync copying what the other done perfectly. I got out of the car and watch the small lights rise into the sky then roll over and come back down like floating on air but again in perfect sync.  They then did the same thing over the house. They then rose into the sky and started east.  The front light did a corkscrew move and the one behind it did the same corkscrew move.  They then both drop down at the field still I sync! heading still east. Then rose up over the trees and gone.  The trees were on a knoll so when they went over the trees they dropped over the knoll and out of my sight. I did not see them after that.  I didn&rsquo;t hang around very long either because I was a little spooked.The whole sighting from the time I saw what I thought were sparks till they were out of my sight was no more then a minute total.  The strange thing was these lights looked small. They looked only the size of a person or maybe a little bigger but not much. I could use the house and trees as a reference and to me they looked small. I am no expert on judging objects in the sky and I my be wrong but to me they could not have been bigger then a small car if that big.}

The light was a off-white color, almost yellowish.  There were NO blinking lights on the craft like you would normally see on a normal aircraft.  After it flew by, I could still see the bright light, but then I could make out 3 white lights in the rear.  It was too dark to see the shape of the craft.  Did I mention it was very quiet?  Normally a craft flying overhead, you can see the blinking lights, and normally at that altitude you can hear the jet engines.  I did not.  All lights were an off-white to yellowish color, and I could not hear the engines.  Looked to be traveling at normal speeds of a jet craft.

I was out walking my dog at about 9:30pm it was just about fully dark out with a half moon to light up the sky.  I just happened to look up into the sky in time to see a dark object in the sky flying faster than any aircraft I have ever seen.  It had no lights and made no sound.  It was out of my viewing range in a matter of 5 seconds.  It was flying really low between 1500 and 1800 feet.  But it was too dark to see anything physical about it or any shape.  There is no military base near here and just the shear speed of it just really makes me wonder what I had just seen.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We are both in our mid-20s, college graduates, work regular jobs, have NO experience with UFOS or aliens.  While travelling back to port at Seattle from Victoria, BC, we happened to notice a meteor shower during the late evening of August 12th.  We ended up watching this meteor shower for several hours.  The meteors were amazing, ranging in many sizes and colors.  Around 1:40am (now Friday the 13th), my boyfriend noticed something unusual in the sky.  He saw two uniform spheres of light appear in the sky, move in a figure 8 motion, and then disappear.  He quickly tried to explain this to me in his bewildered state, but within a few seconds these two lights appeared in the sky again and we both saw them.  The spheres were always equidistant apart, as if they were attached by some invisible pole, and danced around each other very quickly and sharply.  The lights moved in a zig zag pattern, back and forth for abo! ut 5 seconds before flying a straight path over the ship and we could no longer see them from our balcony.  The lights were a little larger in comparison to the stars and seemed to appear from mid air in the sky.  We sat in shock for a very long time, trying to come up with a logical explanation, and hoping to see them again. These lights were absolutely not meteors, they moved in several different directions and left no light tail, and they were solid white lights, no blinking or shimmering. We also thought that possible the military was trying some new type of aircraft, maybe a new invisible plane and all we could see were the two lights on it?   But there was no sound, and with the speed these lights were traveling I&rsquo;d expect a very loud rocket sound.  So my theory is now that these lights were either one or two UFOs, maybe aliens use meteor showers to hide their arrivals?   I would definitely love to know if there is a logical explanation, I don&rsquo;t think I will ever stop wondering what we saw and it may just drive me crazy!  This was seen while we were in the Strait of Juan Fuca/Clallam Bay near Port Angeles.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Hello Peter, Thank you for getting back to me so quickly!  I will definitely have my boyfriend prepare his own independent statement.  Its just absolutely unbelievable, I never expected to see a UFO in my entire life.  Half of me still thinks there is no way I could have seen a UFO and there has to be some explanation, but the other half knows that there is nothing on Earth I know of that moves like that, and there is no way we both could have imagined seeing the exact same thing.  To be honest, I feel a little crazy.  I&apos;ve always believed in other life, its bogus to think that we are the only living planet in an unimaginably vast galaxy,  I guess I just never expected to see for myself.  Either way, it was a once in a lifetime experience and I would definitely welcome another! I will have my boyfriend, Eyad, submit his report though the web form.  Thank you again for contacting me!((END ADDENDUM))((2ND ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Hello Peter, You can definitely use my additional comments.

This was like if an edge of a coin were lit up in a line and it wasn&rsquo;t really moving.Then it slowly tilted with purpose (again this was strange to me because if it were a man made prop or something far away the effort to so even would be quite difficult) like when you weigh something with those doctor scales and you get the lead weight right it kind of has this slow settling into place as it gets its balance.  Like that. It tilted in that &lsquo;gaining balance&rsquo; way for another 20 degrees tilting down on the right side.Suddenly it looked like it was moving forward away from me for a moment and then I got this sense of a burst of incredible speed because the lights became smaller so quick they practically winked out they were gone so fast.I was not tired. I was not drunk.  I have never made such a claim before.  I saw my first UFO.  I have no idea what it was alien, military, or otherwise but Unidentified Flying Object.  Oh yes.}"

When we saw them we got out of the car and we were just staring at them and trying to figure out what they were.  There were two really big like the size of a spot light they were bright yellow/gold lights flickering.  One was on top of the other.  The bottom one was a bit off set from the top one.  They were not moving at at all.  The top light started to slowly fade.  A few seconds later the bottom one faded out too.  The both just faded into the dark sky.My boyfriend is a photographer and I am a legal assistant.}

We saw several bright shooting stars before a brief rainshower passed through and everyone bugged out.  Took everyone home, and by the time everyone was home, it had cleared up again, so I decided to drive back up the mountain to see the peak by myself.  I arrived at about 3:30 AM, parked and set out in my chair behind my car with all lights off... about one or two per minute for at least an hour! Ink black sky, Milky way easily visible with the naked eye.  It was beautiful.  Then, I noticed something flashing through the trees to the east. It was a VERY brigh pure white light flashing so brightly it could be seen through the treeline, very low.  I waited for it to pass from behind the trees, and it raised in altitude and changed from a single white light brighter than any star in the sky to a row of 2-3 ! orange lights in a line, which seemed to pulsate or move left to right.  What scared me was the maneuverability.  This thing was flying &quot;S&quot; shaped patterns up and down over the treeline, estimated max altitude 2000 ft., apparent size as big as a pinky fingernail width at arms length.  It started flying in the same direction as the road I drove up to get to the lookout, and I got scared, so I instantly popped my trunk, folded my chair and threw it in as fast as aI could and hit the &quot;unlock&quot; button on my car. As soon as the car unlocked, all the car lights went on, and I thought &quot;SH*T&quot;!  I looked up, and the three orange lights became one much brighter orange light, almost looked like it was shining something at me, like it saw me.  I instantly hopped in my car, cranked it and tried to run in a panic... the car cranked very very slowly for a few seconds, and the lights dimmed before it started up and I drove away. I was scared because I had to drive in the direction of the thing to get out of there so I floored it very fast, narrowly missing a deer.Looked up, and at one second could see the thing through my winshield, which scared me even more. I didn;t feel safe until the road went under the dense tree canopy. There was no noise at all, and no contrails. All I can say is, never again by myself.  Been up there several times to look at stars with people, and we often see solid lights at high altitude on ballistic trajectories, probably satellites, but this was low and bright, and abnormal.  Don;t know what it was, but never again by myself at that hour..}"

I have met with the witness who wishes to remain anonymous due to his position as a doctor in the community.  The witness was very adamant that he saw what he described and seemed like a very level headed man.  This is a preliminary report on this sighting and there will be follow ups posted as more information becomes available to the OUFOR2.  Below is the information from the online sighting report.Date of sighting: 7/24/2010  Event time: 11:45pm  Event duration: 2 minutes  Altitude of craft: 500 to 1000 feet  Approximate size of craft: 100 to 200 feet across the flat sides ( Equilateral triangle)   (Weather conditions added by OUFOR2 after researching)  Weather conditions: Clear skies, moon lit night.State: Oregon  Country: USA  Zip Code: 97219 (Mountain Park area of Portland )   Number of witnesses to the event: 1  Shape of craft if any: Triangular  Number of craft seen: 1  FFull sighting description from witness statement:  I was walking my dog out to do his nightly business in the park near my home (Nansen Park ) and while I was waiting for him to finish up I caught sight of something out of the corner of my left eye to the west of me and turned to look.  I saw 3 whitish lights moving towards me ( to the east ) at what I thought was about 500 to 1000 feet in the air. As it drew closer I was able to make out the crafts shape as triangular in fashion. It drifted slowly over head and away to the northeast and seemed to speed up the further it got from me until it was gone. There was no sound that I could hear and my dog did not react to it at all. I would like to know what this may have been, but, due to my being a doctor I request to be kept anonymous in the public eye.Contact info withheld by request of the witness.Initial findings:  I met with the witness on 7/28/2010 in the park and asked him a barrage of the usual questions and from first impressions I found him to be a stable intelligent man without an agenda or any obvious deceptive statements.  He seemed truly perplexed and concerned about the sighting and was not making any rash statements about it being an alien craft or a craft of known origins. He seemed fairly savvy on the local ( usual ) air traffic in his neighborhood too.  He did repeat several times that &ldquo; It was like nothing I have every seen before. The OUFOR2 will be conducting further checks with the FAA at the PDX tower and also by contacting the Oregon Air National Guard at PDX as well. OUFOR2 has already checked the weather conditions for the sighting date and has confirmed that the witnesses statement and the official weather conditions match.Shown below are views of the location via map and also forensic models built to illustrate the witnesses sighting.  The witness has viewed the forensic reconstruction models and has agreed that they closely represent what he viewed that night. There has been added detail to the forensic model from information that the witness expounded upon during our interview.  These models are NOT 100% accurate as to what may have been witnessed since there was only one witness and no photographs or videos taken.}"

I then looked around to see if others had seen the object, and noticed that several other patrons were already staring skyward.  We began to ask each other if we were seeing the same thing, and if we had any idea what it was.My initial reaction was that I was seeing some sort of balloon suspended in the sky with a light shining on it.  However, I quickly realized that the light was being emitted from the object itself.  I felt very strange as I stared upwards in disbelief along with several others.  The orange orb appeared to be changing its shape.  Its movements during this time are hard to describe, but seemed to be pulsing.The nightclub featured many patrons with glow sticks and other flashing lights.  A DJ was playing electronic music from the roof terrace.  I began pointing at the object with two glow sticks to help others see what I was talking about.  At this time, it began to pull back further up into the sky.  The light became dimmer and it moved near what appeared to be a star in the sky, slightly to the west at about 60 degrees above the horizon.Over approximately the next twenty to thirty minutes, the orange glowing orb would generally move in a methodical fashion between several stars / planets in the night sky.  Sometimes it would move slowly and deliberately, while other times it would move in quick movements.  On one occasion, while pointing the light out to another individual, we watched as it slowly approached a star, and then made a semi-circle movement around the star, and then proceed in a straight line.  Based on my own amateur use of a night sky computer program, I believe that this star may have been Altair.I tried to take a picture of the object with my phone&apos;s camera. The object did not appear on the camera, however, an unexplained square orange shape appeared on one image, which I would be happy to provide if needed.  I did not see any square shapes with the naked eye.At least 15 to 20 patrons witnessed the same event over the course of approximately 20 to 30 minutes.  After I went to find others and return, patrons could no longer locate the object.The coordinates of the sighting location are 39.293&apos; North, 76.611&apos; West.I am currently a Ph.D. student at a university in the Washington, DC, area.}"

Decided to run and grab my wifes Canon Rebel XST camera so I could get a few shots of the clouds using a zoom lens.  I was bare footed and climbed on some small landscaping rocks near the pool to get higher so the block fence wouldn&apos;t be in the way.  I took a total of eight photos within less than two minutes.  When I downloaded the photos I noticed the first four had an object moving through the photos at a downward angle to the left.  I seemed to be fairly distant as I never saw it with my eyes.  It probably only took me 30 or 40 seconds to take the first 5 or 6 photos because the rocks were hurting my feet and I wanted to get down to the pool deck where I took about two more.  I showed my wife and she thought I might have had something on the lens. If I did it came off quick because the last four photos do not show the object.  I zoomed in on ! the photos to see if I could detect a shape. Two looked oval and the other two appeared to have a saucer shape.  I have no idea what it is but it is strange and I don&apos;t think anything was on the lens.  I have the unalterd photos if you want them.}

I have a simple little digital camera, which would be impossible to add special effects to video on it.The light seemed to be solid blue on one side and solid red on the other.

At about 10:30, we all laid on the deck and were enjoying the clear skies, stars, and a few meteors.Shortly after 11, my sister&rsquo;s boyfriend pointed out a very bright glow (appeared golf ball sized) to the east.  We all sat up to look, at first thinking it was a meteor.  The light appeared to be getting closer.  After 30 seconds or so, we knew it wasn&rsquo;t a meteor because we could see the light was coming from some type of aircraft.  It appeared to be a headlight, the beam went out into the night sky like a flashlight.  It was NOT a spotlight&mdash;it did not shine down.  The craft continued to move forward, it was moving west.  On one side of the craft was a small blue light and on the other side a small red light, similar to airplanes.  As the craft moved overhead we could see it was triangular shaped and was close, not so close where we&rsquo;d be alarmed but closer than airplanes normally fly.  We watched as the craft very quietly moved west , dipped and glided toward the north, dipped down and up a few more times, and was finally out of view.We were all stunned at what we saw and returned to the deck to continue watching for meteors.  Less than 5 minutes later from the same point in the sky, the bright yellow circular glow appeared again.  We witnessed the same thing again with the same (if not very similar) flight pattern.  This time we all heard what we describe as a &quot;whirring&quot; noise.  After this one was out of view we began to walk from the front yard to the back yard again when we immediately saw another one of the exact same appearance.  This led us to believe there were minimally 2 separate crafts since our 2nd sighting had vanished only seconds earlier.My sister&rsquo;s boyfriend left at 11:40 p.m..  My sister and I drove south down Dixie Highway for about 5 minutes in an attempt to find better views.  As we turned around and headed back, we had our 4th sighting.My sister&rsquo;s boyfriend called shortly after midnight (8/13/10) to say he was outside of his home in Trenton, MI, and was witnessing the same yellow glow.  However, this time the glow hovered at a farther distance for several minutes.  It did not move overhead to reveal the triangular shaped aircraft, but instead simply hovered.My sister and I stayed outside until approximately 2:00 a.m. (8/13/10) and saw a few more meteors but did not have another sighting of the aircraft.  We emailed our local channel 4 news to see if anyone else reported a sighting or if there was an possibility of some type of military practice.

The time was around 9:30PM - 10:00PM. We were driving to Millen Georgia on I-25 if I remember correctly around Portal when we observed what we believe to be multiple UFOs.  This wasn&apos;t the first time, I had seen a very similar thing close to that area as a child maybe 10-15 years ago.  You can see from the map on this link exactly where the sighting took place between I-16 and Millen somewhere on I-25 heading north from I-16...http://www.flashearth.com/?lat=32.554451&amp;lon=-81.86212&amp;z=10.8&amp;r=0&amp;src=msl  What was seen cannot be described any other way but very ominous, for me anyway.  I was looking straight ahead at the road through the front windshield and didn&apos;t notice anything.  I was in the middle of conversation when my mother, who was driving, said &quot;Hey, is that a UFO?&quot; jokingly.  It was directly in my line of sight however I didn&apos;t seem to see anything until she said something.  When I focused my eyes I began to see Orange/redish or more like golden colored lights in the sky.  Roughly 2 or 3, although she had been looking longer and counted 5 or 6, approximatly 300 to 600 yards high off the ground.  As I had just glanced and only witnessed 2 or 3 for no more than 5-8 seconds, they all simply faded out at the same exact time.  The odd thing is that it couldn&apos;t have been clouds covering them because they all did it simultaneously and they were approximately 2 or 3 miles from each other, spread apart throughout the sky in front of us.My mother claimed that the other ones that I had not seem did the same thing a few seconds earlier.  Then another golden light appeared maybe 2 or 3 minutes later to our front/left.  It was very high up at first and only visible for a few seconds then faded out, far too high to be a light tower.  Then this proccess repeated with no noticeable pattern of timing with only 1 golden light for about the next 10 minutes.  I do some photo minipulation and 3D work for my career so I know distances, angles, and optical illusions very well and this was no illusion.  As we got closer it began to appear lower and lower to the ground, another indication it was not a light tower. It never got under maybe 90 ft from the ground though.  The last time we saw it, it was on the left side of I-25 going north and about 1 mile to the left I believe.  It would disappear, then suddenly appear again in its quite unique golden color for about half a minute or so in different places and appeared to be completely still then it would fade out again.  It was very steady, no pulsing just faded in then out again. I later relayed this info to some family members who live in the area and they said that they had seen some very similar things at other times as well around there. Another interesting detail is that the very next night an extremely severe Lightning storm occurred in that same area. Literally the most severe Electrical Storm I have ever encountered. The thunder was loud enough to cause the entire house to tremble, and it had a sharpness to it that a .44 magnum revolver couldn&apos;t reproduce if it went off right next to your head. I&apos;ve heard that many sightings take place just before or after very severe lightning storms. One of the reasons this was so ominous to me is that I had recently had a dream of seeing a large UFO only a week earlier, which is not a common dream for me. In the dream seeing this UFO was so daunting that it terrified me and I awoke, a dream I&apos;ll not soon forget. On many occasions I have made predictions from my dreams that I discussed with people that later came true, this dream had a similar feeling so I did discuss this with my mother before the sighting took place. In the dream my mother was next to me on my left just as she was during the sighting. I reported this on another website as well, and someone had a very similar sighting with lights of the same color and character only 30-40 miles south of that location in Jesup Georgia just 2 months before.

About 5-6 minutes later my friend pointed out a really bright light in the western sky just above the tree line, we watched this bright light for a good half an hour, during this time we watched this light change from red to green to blue and also white.This light also would appear to just blink out completely for 3-4 seconds and then appear again but several feet in the sky to its left and our right, it also looked like it was moving up and down left and right and even at times in small circles this light disappeared 5 times 4 of the 5 it would re-appear but each time it came back it was a little more to its left, the 5th time it went out it did not come back.We had no clue what we were looking at and jokingly I said to my friend what would you do if it disappeared and all of a sudden it was right above us, as I finished saying that I kind of jumped and said holly shit that just scared the shit out of me, my friend quickly looked in my direction and said what?, and I replied oh that plane coming across the lake with its landing lights on, we kind of laughed but kept watching the plane, as it got closer it started looking more and more not like a plane,  My friend asked is there an airport close by and I said no why?  And he said then why would it be so low and have its landing lights on?  Well this got us both really watching these 2 lights that I thought at first was a plane with its landing lights on, it was getting closer and we still didn`t hear any noise.As it got closer we could see it better it had 2 large flood lights in the front but we didn`t see the standard red and green blinking lights on the wings, and still didn`t hear any sound from it we were sitting in the car with the sunroof open, and the craft was coming right at us from my left across the lake. It flew just about right over us, as it got right above us it was about 3-400 feet up and it flew through a small cloud as it got right above us that was when we heard a very low like rumbling sound nothing like a plane at all, but when it entered the cloud those huge spot lights in the front lit up the whole cloud and it illuminated the whole craft in like a golden aura, that was when the 2 of us really got a good look at it and I can say it scared the hell out of us both!! It looked like a large triangle, the first thing my friend said was holy shit look at that it looks like a pyramid flying over us!! It had the 2 large lights in the front and one large strobe in t! he back there were no other standard lights at all on this thing! what I saw was what looked like a pyramid sitting on top of this black triangle I also saw well the only way I can describe it as a half of an arch going from half way from the rear point of the triangle from the front arching up to this pyramid shape that was on top of the triangle.On the inside of this arch looking part on the pyramid part it looked like either a row of six windows that were illuminated from inside with a golden light or maybe it was just a row of 6 golden lights. It wasn`t moving very fast at all, maybe like 40-50 MPH because we got a good look, as it went over us for I would say maybe 4-5 seconds. On the right side of the road, is a row of pine trees as it went over these trees, I jumped out of the car and ran to the other side of the road just past the row of trees is a swampy area roughly a quarter of a mile across then you hit the rest of the woods.It looked to us like it had dropped even lower when it passed the first row of trees to where I thought it was either going to land or crash into this swampy area, but when I got to the tree line I could see this thing start to move back up and over the wooded area on the other side of the swamp, and it  seemed to just blink out of sight.I have never seen anything like this in my life, and I have seen a lot of different aircraft, I am a Navy vet that served during the Gulf war.I have been trying to draw what I saw but I am not a very good artist, after we got back in the car I realized my new cell phone had a camera and does take video I am really kicking myself in the butt for not thinking of using the phone to either video it or at least get a few snap shots of this thing!}"

19701015,10/15/1970,20100823,8/23/2010, London (UK/England),INT,INT,UK,#N/A, unknown,30 minutes,30,1800,very long,"Single bright cone shaped beam of light.I found this site by accident, and it sparked a memory of something I observed 40 years ago.The actual date is lost to me now, but I believe it was Autumn 1970, possibly October as it was dark at 7pm when I left my parent&rsquo;s apartment to attend an evening institute class.  It was in a suburb of North London called Finsbury Park.  I was 20 years of age and considered myself observant.Their apartment was at the top of a block about 50ft off the ground.  Their front door led out onto a balcony walkway with an unobstructed view over approximately a half mile square plot of land that had about six water filtration reservoirs surrounded by a collection of low buildings that I would guess, housed tool stores, offices and maintenance vehicles.  Apart from the residential viewpoint I was looking from, there were blocks of houses to the left and to the right of the filtration plant.  A busy main road ran along the front of the plant site, about a half mile from where I was standing.What I saw from the balcony was a cone of very bright light pointing down from above.  The wide circle of light slowly and methodically searched the reservoirs and buildings in circular motions.  The sky was inky black and the reservoir area was only lit by low powered security lights as the place was only worked in during daylight hours and never, as far as I can recall, at night.  At no time during this sighting could I make out any shape looking up at the apex of the light beam.I called my father out and asked him what he thought it might be?  He said, &lsquo;I think it&rsquo;s an helicopter!&rsquo;  I invited him to listen and he had to admit that all he could actually hear was the faint sound of the traffic on the main road, half a mile away and nothing else.  We stared at the light for another five minutes, then my father suggested that it might be a secret silent running helicopter with an astonishingly bright light that we don&rsquo;t know about?  I suppose it was as good an explanation as we were going to get, though I rather doubted it on the grounds that if the military had perfected such a thing, then why did they insist on using extremely noisy machines in war zones? (to this day)  That&rsquo;s the thing about helicopters, the noise, you can always hear an helicopter even if you can&rsquo;t see it, the noise will bounce off buildings and trees which will make you look in the wrong place for it even if it&rsquo;s behind you.  Unlike this thing which was somewhere in front of us and poss! ibly above us, but totally silent.I left the apartment and made my way down to the main road.  On the way, I entered a gap in the houses and this time got a side view, ground level looking up at the cone, still I couldn&rsquo;t see anything on top of it, and it remained totally silent. Next I went to the main road and stared at the same view, this time with my parents apartment block behind the light source.  No silhouette, no sound other than the traffic behind me as the beam of light continued on it&rsquo;s rounds of the site.  I stopped a man passing by and asked him to look at the light.  He didn&rsquo;t, he just looked at me then accused me of being a drug addict. I got on a bus to go to my class and tried to get some passengers to look out of the window, most just looked at me, and the only guy who bothered to look out said it was an helicopter!  Helicopters were not that common in the U.K. back then as they are now.  Police helicopters and Air Ambulances are such a common sight these days that they seldom register.  Certainly the military had them back then, but you never saw any in suburban areas.When I witnessed this event, I was keen to tell as many people as possible.  Firstly, when I tried to inform whatever authority I could find, the Police, local government, newspapers, Water Authority and the BBC, was treated with disbelief or just plainly ignored.  The only thing the Police was interested in was where I had obtained the Water Board&rsquo;s (Water Authority) phone number from when I told them that I had already spoken to them, and they told me to contact the Police.Over the years, I have related that story to people who I believed might make some intelligent use of it, but all I&rsquo;ve ever got was ridicule and anger.  One smart guy I thought better of, shouted &lsquo;YOU SAW A HELICOPTER&rsquo; and refused to talk about ever again.  People who were not there at the time and people who were not even born at the time have accused me of being on drugs, drunk, mentally unstable or just a plain old liar.  Some have offered physical abuse while a few have actually hit me.  The worst I suppose was having someone at a party tell the other guests that I&rsquo;d seen a flying saucer with little green me in it.  No!  I would try to explain, what I encountered was a U.F.O.  It was above me, so &lsquo;Flying&rsquo;.  It was, I&rsquo;m sure, an &lsquo;Object&rsquo; and it was and remains so, &lsquo;Unidentified&rsquo;   A couple of years before that happened, I saw what appeared to be an aircraft flying high in the night sky. The single tiny white light was constant and moved in a straight line across the sky quite slowly giving the impression of great height.  Then directly above me, the light made an abrupt 70 degree angular turn and shot upwards and was gone in a second.  The various explanations I have been offered, either cynically or violently have been:-  You saw a...comet, a shooting star, a meteor, an aeroplane, a spy plane, a weather balloon, a satellite, a Chinese Lantern, the Moon and even Venus.  It&rsquo;s little wonder I haven&rsquo;t mentioned these things too much over the last four decades.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))}"

It was silver or gray with no tail rudder and appeared to be standing still then suddenly began moving southeast perpendicular to the ground. It suddenly picked up speed and disappeared into the horizon leaving behind a light white beam-like tracer that quickly faded.Everyone on the road and in the vicinity saw the fireball/meteorite because traffic slowed down, several people swerved to avoid hitting each other. The meteorite made the local news but I have not seen any reports of the craft that emerged from it.

This has caught my attention because the light never went away. At one point the trajectory of the rocket stands still and begins to transform into a small disk and started approaching the city and the area of observation. I left the area of the bridge and sticked close to a building that could give me a possibility of covered area but continued to attend the same approach. However, the subject held his course, and exhibited an additional light that turned towards the bridges. Returned to walk in another direction, for example, approaching the other side and turned his light towards a monument. When the subject has stopped in the area of observation it was almost over my head. While standing on top of the observation zone, its light (which to me seeme! d a kind of probe) directed her toward the area of nightlife  and then went in the direction of the bridge next to the West . Being the nearest point of observation, I note the discoid shape of the object, brown with a more nebulous area in the base bottom center of the disc, giving the idea that this area is moving. The object was low in altitude, no more than 100 meters. The subject did not exhibit any noise or sound. Returning to move slowly forward until the next bridge, also changing its path. Stopped over this (where many people walked) and drove his light / probe towards the main street and monument of the city. Speeding up and leaned for a moment seemed to gain a little altitude and then dive (giving the notion of sudden loss of altitude) towards the northwest on the horizon of observation (almost like land), disappearing. The observation lasted at least a minute.

There was an Airshow going on at the Santa Rosa Charles Shultz Airport and as my girlfriend and I were walking out of walmart we were looking in the sky towards the west direction watching a jet in the sky.  Once it was out of sight we got into the car and proceeded to drive home.  Before getting on the freeway heading west on Shiloh road in Windsor Ca, myself and one passenger in my car both witnessed a very strange craft in the sky about 1000 feet ahead of us.  It was flying really low, maybe 100 to 200 feet max. above the road.  It was a cylinder object with a fan looking propeller device at the back end of it. Instead of a propeller on the front of it like a normal looking plane.  It was a bright silver, almost white looking color. It looked to be about 20 or 30 feet long by 10 to 15 feet wide-(about ! the size of a personal 1 to 2 man plane)   Like I said there was an airshow going on so I was kind of looking towards the sky when it happened, and so when I saw it I thought to myself am I really seeing this?- what is this thing flying so low and it seemed to be moving at a good speed but I could see it so clearly.  And as I thought that my friend riding in the passenger seat yelled out &quot;look at that!&quot; and we were both in such awe because we think we just a ufo.

It was the brightest object in the sky except for Jupiter which was to the east area of the sky.  Moon not visible as it had already set.As I watched I realized the flashing lights did not move in relation to the trees in the yard of the house next door to the south of me.  After 5 minutes (40 miles of jet airliner flight distance) it still remained in the same position.I walked to where my driveway meets the street some 100 feet west of where I first spotted them to get a better view of the lights.  They were still in the same place.I returned to my house side door and retrieved my 20X80 binoculars to determine if I could see anything with the use of them.  Going back to the driveway entrance I used the binoculars and could see that the lights were changing colors and very quickly.  Red, blue, white, green colors were visible with the glasses but of course the image was all over the place. I placed them on the top of the fence post at the entrance of my driveway and although it steadied the image somewhat it was still only a bouncing globe of lights moving around.  Like trying to watch a star with high power glasses, almost impossible.Although I watched the lights for about 30 minutes, less the time to get the binoculars, they appeared to remain the same intensity and with multicolors.The position was about where I would expect to see Arcturus, the star the tail of the Big Dipper leads to.  Maybe it was that star, although I have looked at it hundreds of times, including from the flight deck of jet airliners.  I have never noticed it have coloring and flashing brightly like it did tonight.The object was about 35 degrees above the horizon and the sky is clear although there could have been some smoke from the forest fires that occur this time of year adding particulates to the atmosphere and perhaps giving a view that I have never seen before.I stopped watching at 23:45.}"

Our family friend had told us all the flights were delayed or canceled  because of the thunder storm and severe rain we were having.  While we were standing outside his house in the drive way he saw a really bright light. He said, &quot;Come here and look at this.&quot;  I was standing where tree branches were blocking my view so I couldn&rsquo;t see what he was pointing at. When I stepped closer to where he was standing and looked into the night sky I saw a bright hovering disk (it had a disk like shape but the light surrounding it was rectangle).  It was very bright and looked far away, yet the whole craft was brilliantly lit. It emitted a yellow/golden light in color. We both stood looking at the flying object until it flew straight into the clouds.  During the short amount of time we saw the UFO, it maintained the hovering position, not moving anywhere, for about 5 seconds.  Then went up a few feet in the air (from our perspective) and back down to the original position.   After this the UFO flew straight up into the clouds at a super fast speed.  It looked like it disappeared. There were no more lights emitting from the craft.This is my first encounter with anything to do with UFO&rsquo;s or aliens. I can&rsquo;t explain what I saw.

I looked for the object with 8x42 binoculars, but could not see anything.  About 6 seconds later, I observed another flash(object), then 2 seconds later, another flash in  the same area of the sky.  At the same time, a two engine, wide body commerial jet (flying out of Toronto International airport) came into the vicinity of the flash.  Next the object turned on, what seemed to me to be dark yellow landing lights.  I thought the object was trying to let the commerial aircraft know that it was in the area.  The object&apos;s lights were on for less than 3 seconds and it was gone.  Again, I tried to look for the object with binoculars, but couldn&apos;t see anything.  At first I thought it was a military aircraft or UAV, but as far as I know Cananda doesn&apos;t fly that type of aircraft over domestic soil and if they did,I don&apos;t think that they would fly it in a commerial air corridor-travlling NNW to SSE (same direstion as some satellites)-random blinking light-80 degree elevation from observation point-estimated speed, 500 to 600 mph -estimated altitude, 10,000 to 15,000 ft -observation location, Latitude 43.82290 Longitude -79.01230  I am an amateur astronomer and an aviation buff, at night I&apos;ve seen birds flying, different types of aircraft, meteors, satellites, spent boosters, space junk, etc., but I have never seen anything like this.}"

I lived North of the city, pretty dark in those days.The first:  Facing South, a white, star-like solid light, like a medium size star, appeared in the sky very, very high up, at an almost-directly-overhead latitude and crossing the sky coming out of the East to West. I immediately thought it was a satellite. Way too high to be an airplane.  It was either already in space or just on the fringe. And faster than a satellite I was use to seeing.But just as I told the person I was with to &quot;look, it&apos;s a satellite&quot;, the object stopped crossing the sky half way, almost directly overhead, and literally stopped on a dime, and then went straight up into space, fading out.  It didn&apos;t continue across the sky like a satellite would and then instantly &apos;blink&apos; out when it went into earth&apos;s shadow.  This object went straight up.  A 90-degree instant &apos;turn&apos; up into space.  I verified this in my mind by acknowledging that it did not &apos;cross&apos; any more stars in any direction.I&apos;m a private pilot, university graduate and voluminous readings, I know of nothing that would act like this, particularly that it was so high to start with, traverse half the sky, and then abruptly stop and go into space and fade out, not suddenly blink out.Now here&apos;s the kicker:  about six years later, my wife and I were standing in my backyard, same house, facing North this time, looking up towards the horizon, not straight up.  I had told her my UFO story.Suddenly, There...I instantly knew it was the same &apos;object&apos;, probably because it&rsquo;s so different then my &lsquo;normal&rsquo;.It suddenly appeared coming at us, from North to South this time, crossing the sky towards us at a very fast speed.  Both were traveling much faster then the satellites I&apos;ve seen crossing the sky.  So, from first sighting it near the horizon to it going up into space took about seven seconds and then another two/three seconds as it faded out)   Without taking my eyes off of it this time, I told my wife, &quot;see the light coming at us?&quot;   Watch...it&rsquo;s going to come almost overhead, stop, and then go straight up into space and fade out!   And it did just that as I was describing what it would do to her!!  Again, never went &apos;by&apos; any more starts verifying that it did indeed go &apos;straight up&apos; into space.And now I have a witness who&apos;s always with me (married). so now it&apos;s &apos;we&apos; who saw it!  Ran across your article in the SOCO Magazine here in Boston MA and thought I&apos;d send you this &apos;tale&apos;.  I&apos;ve seen rockets launched in the Air Force (I worked on Minuteman Missiles), saw the shuttle launch in Fla., a missile &apos;blowup&apos; just after launch in New Mexico (from our backyard in Phx) leaving the colorful contrails from the rising morning sun, we&apos;ve seen satellites, the shuttle, the space station (as I acknowledged, they cross the &apos;entire&apos; sky then suddenly blink out when they go into the earth&apos;s shadow) but I&rsquo;ve never seen anything this high in the sky, just a &apos;bright&apos; dot of a light, that initially looked like a satellite but traveling much faster, stop on &apos;a dime&apos;, and go straight up into space and just fade out.Any ideas as to what these/this could have been?((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The object traveled in a straight, unvarying course.  When it passed over a cloud I could easily estimate where it would come out again further up the path. I just happened to look up at an aircraft that was heading south (I presume coming from Vandenberg due to its low altitude) and saw the object pass over it.  Round, white but not reflective, no noise and at first I thought it might be a parachute from the aircraft.  But after a few seconds it was obvious it was not an aircraft.  From when I saw it to when it was out of view was between 1 and 1.5 minutes. My niece was outside at the same moment and she saw it too.  There are storms coming in from the north-west and the wind is also swirling so any balloon or something like that should not have traveled in a straight line.

I finally come to an exit on the highway, and I was to see if i can get closer to it. This must be at least 30 miles from where i first see it. I get off the highway and go south, finding the roads to get! me closer. I must have tried for maybe 20 minutes to get closer. I finally stop I get out of my car and take a look. It was cylinder in shape, like a soda can, with the &quot;top&quot; facing up. No wings, not a hot air balloon, not a hellicopter, did not hear any sounds of an engine.

It was clear less humidity in the air and sparce fluffy clouds from a little rain we had that night.As i sat looking up waiting to see what would happen some jets passed overhead and i decided to photograph them figuring i would get those little non-seen UFOs around the jets. I photographed two jets passing and waited. Just them at 10.39.24 i see a silver star appear exactly were i saw the V UFO yesterday. I jumped up with my camera totally pumped and excited aimed the camera and it wouldnt focus, i switched to manual and shot, switched to auto and shot more. The Probe started moving slowly to the east from the west with the direction of the wind, clouds were slowly passing by it. As the probe passed over head i tried to get some video but it would nt work  i started shooting as best i could, i then see a jet coming rite at the Probe and i thought the probe would disapear but i didnt, the people in the jet must have seen the probe as it passed pretty close but both jet and UFO were in a light fuzz hazzy cloud, my camera wouldnt focus, the jet then went by, i shot more, ! then another jet was coming rite at it again and it passed by in another fuzzy cloud, my camera wouldnt focus, if the pilots missed it they shouldnt be pilots i thought. I was alittle frustrated because the jet and UFO would had been great shots. As i shot more photos a jet higher up than the UFO came from the East heading West i snapped great focused shots of the UFO and jet. As the UFO probe headed to the east towards the tree i ripped off as many shots as i could until it went out of sight. In total i got 110 shots as it passed overhead. I then felt it wasnt over so i waited looking around for a few minutes seeing nothing, i grabbed the camera coffee and radio swatting mosquitoes in the miserable zombie heat and headed in the house, i looked over the far trees and over them i saw a flashing object moving west, reminded me of snow goose in flight then i remembered my Chatham sighting of the object that flashed like a snow goose, i quickly sat my coffee and radio down turn! ed as fast as i could to shoot it and it was gone in a split s! econd, i t could have been a Ring-Billed gull, but ill never no cause i missed it!!. In the house processing i picked the best, focused and silver shinny shots of the craft and enlarged and enhanced them. in all the photos there seems to be some sort of plasma dripping out of the craft in every shot. Also in a couple of shots there seems to be a black dot on the bottom of the whatever it is. Awsome! im so pumped up over this sighting.

Initially I dismissed the objects as airplanes as Switzerland lying at the crossroads of Europe sees lots of air traffic.  My initial assessment was deemed incorrect on the basis of other aircraft moving across the sky at altitudes that made it clear that they were indeed aircraft (shape, contrails, speed of movement).  The four objects remained almost motionless, until I witnessed a smaller and less bright object break or drop away from one of the objects.  At this point (after five minutes of viewing) I determined it necessary to gather other witnesses.  I went into my house and asked my girlfriend to come outside with me, and to bring a camera.  When we returned outside, the 4 objects were now 3 and we watched them for approximately 10 more minutes before going inside to look for another camera with! a telephoto lens.  The objects moved slowly, and were hard to see against the brightness of the clear summer sky, often fading into the blue back ground and then returning with intensity in a new location making it difficult to judge their exact location.  The objects moved closer to each other over time, one after the other, never at the same time.  I stopped two other passing strangers to confirm that they could also see the objects, which after a moment of searching (again, bright white objects on a bright blue sky) they found and confirmed.  At this point my girlfriend and myself went inside to look for my camera and telephoto lens.  Upon returning outside the objects had vanished.Photos taken with the smaller digital camera reveal nothing of value.}"

(we were on Via Coronel at this point), the lights came in to view again, unchanged.  Our view was obstructed again as we approached the Palos Verdes Drive West, and was blocked by trees as we headed North for around 1/4 mile.  When there was a break in the trees, we pulled over to give it a better look, and again we saw the lights.The lights were definitely above land, though not extremely high in the sky.  They were as bright or brighter than how Venus usually appears.  We guessed that there was around 1000 ft between each light.  It seemed odd to us that stars would be aligned so perfectly like that, and while we were watching, the middle and upper light started flashing.  The light on top was flashing green and the middle light flashed red.  This continued for approximately one minute, then suddenly a fourth white light zoomed in from the East and into position directly over the green light, and a second or two later the lowest light took off in the opposite direction.Following that, the red and green lights turned white again.  Then one by one, the three remaining lights appeared to be moving away into the opposite direction of where we were.  First, the uppermost light became fainter and fainter, then the middle light and finally the lowest light remained, becoming fainter, and then disappeared.  The entire event probably lasted 30 minutes, though the initial alignment that we saw may have been like that for awhile.(My cell phone battery was dead, or I would&apos;ve taken video of this!)}"

It had the form of a triangle, we could see it for aprx. one minutes and then it disappeard.  It was lighting strong, if it would not move, we could say it is a star. There was no sound. Hearing military area, many would say it is an aircraft of the military, but the lightning was too strong and Croatia does not have any stealth aircraft.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Tonight I went out on my routine walk before bed.  As I was walking west maybe half a mile from my home, I noticed two lights maneuvering around in the sky in the west.  They seemed to be over the city of Lehi and near the Oquirrh Mountains.  I stood and watched them for a minute or two.  They&apos;re maneuvers were so odd.  One would circle the other, they would drop and climb large distances at surprising speed.  After a few moments I decided to carry on watching them at a park just down the street, where a hill would provide a more unobstructed view.  I ran down the street and up the hill and continued to watch.  More odd movements. At a few points, they went from what seemed thousands of feet in the sky, and dropped below the tree line where I couldn&apos;t see them, and came back minutes later.  After they climbed back into the sky, they would stay pretty still for! a while and then begin to move around again.  I know there is a military base nearby, Camp Williams, but I have lived in the area my whole life and never seen anything like this.  I suppose it could have been some sort of training operation, but the movement those lights made were very strange to me.}"

It was while he was doing this that he happened to glance up into the sky and off towards the south-southeast and saw what seemed to be two distinct and very brilliant orange colored lights in the sky at probably not more than one-quarter mile from his observation point. According to the observer, the lights were flying vertically across the sky, with one trailing the other at a distance, estimated by the witness to be between six hundred and one thousand yards, and at an angle of approximately fifty degrees above the horizon.  Suddenly, the leading light source terminated its forward motion and made a sheer vertical acceleration, vanishing into the sky.  The trailing object continued on course, and in a matter of a few seconds was lost behind two story buildings, terminating his observation.}"
